# QUICK PICKLED CUCUMBERS AND ONIONS



#### yields  4 TO 6, ABOUT 2 cup


## ingredients
* 1 medium cucumber 
* 1/4 medium red onion 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/2 cup rice vinegar 
* 1 TBL apple cider vinegar 



## Instructions
1 Cut your cucumber in half lengthwise. Skin on or off, your call. Then cut each half into a

bunch of half-moons no thicker than .25 inch. Cut the onion into wire-coat-hanger-thin strips

no longer than 2 inches.

2 Throw the cucumber and onion slices into a medium bowl, sprinkle them with the salt, and

rub that all in with your hands. You could use a spoon if you are too fucking cool for school,

but why? Pour in the vinegars and toss.

3 Cover this up and stick it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Stir it around and let it sit for at

least another 30 minutes before itâ€™s go time. They will keep in the fridge for about a week.
