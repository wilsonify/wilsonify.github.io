# BUTTERNUT SQUASH QUESO-ISH DIP



#### yields  5 cup, ENOUGH FOR 6 HUNGRY MOTHERFUCKERS


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup butternut squash puree 
* 1/2 cup diced yellow onion 
* 3 TBL all-purpose or whole wheat flour 
* 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin 
* 1 tsp chili powder 
* 1 tsp smoked paprika 
* 3 TBL olive oil 
* 1/2 cup vegetable broth or water 
* 1 cup diced tomatoes with their juices 
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1 or 2 jalapeños, minced 
* 1 TBL lime juice 
* 1/2 tsp salt 



## Instructions
1 Throw the butternut squash puree and onion in a blender and run until that fucker looks smooth. Set aside.

2 In a small bowl, mix together the flour, cumin, chili powder, and smoked paprika.

3 Grab a medium soup pot and warm the olive oil over medium heat. Throw in the flour mixture and keep stirring until it starts to thicken up and smell kinda toasty. Grab a small whisk and slowly add the vegetable broth while you whisk. It’ll start to look like little lumps of Play-Doh. Don’t worry, you aren’t fucking up. Trust the system. Add the diced tomatoes and their juices and keep stirring; it should be a lot smoother looking now with just some tasty tomato chunks.

4 Now pour in the squash-onion mixture, nutritional yeast, garlic, jalapeños, lime juice, and salt. Stir well so there aren’t any chunks, and reduce the heat to low. Let everything simmer together for 3 to 5 minutes so the flavors get all mixed up and the sauce thickens. Taste and add whatever you think it needs to get right by you and your crew. Serve up that golden goodness warm and right away.



## Modifications
You can use canned puree, but it’s easy as hell to make: Skin and chop up a butternut squash into chunks about the size of a coin until you get about 3 cup. Throw it in a pot with a steamer basket and some water, cover, and steam until the squash is tender, about 15 minutes. Throw it in a blender or food processor and boom, fucking puree.

 Canned is cool here.

 WTF?
