# BRUSCHETTA



#### yields  5 cup TOPING, ABOUT 16 BITES, ENOUGH FOR 2 TO 4 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 5 fist-size tomatoes 
* 1/4 cup fresh basil (10 to 12 leaves) 
* 2 tsp lemon juice 
* 2 tsp balsamic vinegar 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1/8 tsp salt 
* 1 clove garlic 
* Crusty bread slices, toasted 



## Instructions
0 chop tomatoes

1 Mix all that shit together (except the bread, dumbass) in a medium bowl and let it chill in the fridge for 30 minutes so all the flavors can hang out and get to know each other. Taste and then add more of what you think it needs. You do you.

2 Serve in a bowl surrounded by the toasted bread or prescoop that shit onto the toasts and pass it around like a bunch of tiny open-faced sammies. Both ways are equally fucking delicious.



## Modifications
To keep this from being too watery, slice the tomatoes in half lengthwise before you get chopping and use a spoon to kinda scoop out all their seeds and guts. That drippy shit brings no flavor to the party. Stop holding yourself to watery standards. Youâ€™re better than that.
