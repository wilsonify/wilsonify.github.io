* 1 or 2 clove garlic 
* 1/3 cup red wine vinegar 
* 1 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1/3 cup olive oil 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* 1/2 large yellow onion 
* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 tsp water 
* 1 tsp liquid smoke 
* MISO-GLAZED CHICKPEAS 
* 2 TBL vegetable broth or water 
* 2 tsp red miso paste 
* 1/2 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas 
* 2 tsp nutritional yeast 
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder 
* 1 romaine heart 
* 1 head of red leaf lettuce 
* Salt and black pepper 
* 1 avocado 
* 2 fist-size tomatoes 
* 1/2 cup chives 



## Instructions
0 chop romaine hear, red leaf lettuce, avacado, and tomatoes; slice onion

1 First, make the dressing. In a small glass, mix together the mustard, maple syrup, and garlic. Whisk in the vinegars. Then slowly add the oil and stir that    up until it’s all combined. Set it in the fridge until it’s go-time.

2 Next, make the onions: In a medium skillet, heat the oil up over medium-high heat. Add the onions and sauté until they start to brown up and look kinda caramelized, 8 to 10 minutes. While that is going down, mix together the soy sauce or tamari, water, and liquid smoke in a small glass. When the onions are done caramelizing, pour the soy sauce mixture over those tasty sons of   and cook until all the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute longer. Scrape them onto a plate and set aside.

3 Now, make the chickpeas: In a small glass, mix together the broth, miso, and soy sauce or tamari. Heat the same skillet the onions were in over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the chickpeas and cook until they warm up and start to look a little golden in some spots, about 2 minutes. Add the miso sauce and cook until all the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and stir in the nutritional yeast and garlic powder until all the chickpeas are coated.

4 To assemble this super salad: Grab a big-ass platter and cover it in chopped lettuce. Gently pour over some of the dressing with some salt and pepper and toss. Add the avocado, tomatoes, chives, smoky onions, and chickpeas on top in nice little rows so everyone will recognize your sick style. Serve right away.



## Modifications
You know what you’re about. Add the extra garlic.

 WTF?

 Really, any miso paste is cool here. Red is just our favorite. Can’t find that    at all? Replace it with 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari and move the   on.

 A 15-ounce can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed, is cool, too.
