# DEVILED CHICKPEA BITES

#### yields 18 BITES, ENOUGH FOR 4 TO 6 PEOPLE

## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas
* vinegar
* shallot
* oil
* water
* nutritional yeast
* 1 1/4 tsp Dijon mustard
* 0.5 baguette, cut into slices no thicker than .5 inch
* 1 large cucumber, thinly sliced
* 1 bunch of chives, minced
* Paprika

# instructions

1 To make the filling, throw the chickpeas, vinegar, shallot, oil, water, nutritional yeast, mustard, and salt into a blender or food processor until it looks all creamy. If your machine sucks, add another TBL of water to get it going.

2 To assemble the bites, smear a little of the chickpea mix on the bread slices so that the cucumbers stick, then place 2 slices of cucumbers on the bread so that the surface is mostly covered. Now you can just spoon 1.5 TBL worth of the chickpea mix on the cucumber slices or you can use the lazy pastry bag method and pile it on

3 Sprinkle the chives over the top and shake on some paprika for looks. Serve within a couple hours of making so that the bread and cucumbers don’t get soggy.

# modifications

One 15-ounce can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed, is no problem.

You can leave the skin on the cucumber if it isn’t too waxy
