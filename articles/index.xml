Code could not finish, some reasons why this could happen: - Plot name not defined. The first parameter of the shortcode is the name. - There is a syntax error. check browser console. function draw(){ test = document.getElementById("plot1"); if (test == null){ console.log("The plot name is not defined") return } fig = null var trace1 = { x: [1, 2, 3, 4], y: [10, 15, 13, 17], type: 'scatter' }; var trace2 = { x: [1, 2, 3, 4], y: [16, 5, 11, 9], type: 'scatter' }; data = [trace1, trace2]; fig = { data: data } if (!</description></item><item><title>Coffee Recipe</title><link>/2017/05/30/Coffee-Recipe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tom.andrew.wilson@gmail.com (Thomas Wilson)</author><guid>/2017/05/30/Coffee-Recipe/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I enjoy coffee, but I find most coffee to be too bitter. This is a symptom of over-extraction.
Here is my recipe for minimally bitter coffee.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tufte in Python</title><link>/2017/04/23/Tufte-in-Python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tom.andrew.wilson@gmail.com (Thomas Wilson)</author><guid>/2017/04/23/Tufte-in-Python/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I greatly admire &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte">Edward Tufte&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After running across &lt;a href="http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/">Tufte in R&lt;/a>.
I thought it would be a fun challenge to port the plots to python.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>100 Year Flood</title><link>/2017/04/18/one-hundred-year-flood/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tom.andrew.wilson@gmail.com (Thomas Wilson)</author><guid>/2017/04/18/one-hundred-year-flood/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="definition">Definition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>100-year flood, means that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_of_exceedance">Annual Exceedance Probability&lt;/a> is 1/100.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a strange term. I cannot think of any other probability that is expressed in this way.
In any case, I want to calculate the 100-year flood plain for my area.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Movie Narrative Chart</title><link>/2017/04/12/movie-narrative-chart/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tom.andrew.wilson@gmail.com (Thomas Wilson)</author><guid>/2017/04/12/movie-narrative-chart/</guid><description>Comic There is a great xkcd about plotting the relationships of characters in a movie. I find it a very elegant way to present information that is otherwise a complicated network of changing relationships.
Primer Of course, the punchline is the movie Primer which involves a substantial amount of time travel. It&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of scribbles. Ha Ha.
Back when I first watched the movie (2011?), I stumbled upon this chart explaining the timelines.</description></item><item><title>TravelMap</title><link>/2017/04/08/travel-map/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tom.andrew.wilson@gmail.com (Thomas Wilson)</author><guid>/2017/04/08/travel-map/</guid><description>travels I wanted to make a digital version of one of large maps where you put actual pins to show where you&amp;rsquo;ve been.
Basemap makes that pretty easy.
My code is on GitHub: travelmap.py

So, I pointed his code a bunch of song lyrics.
Background I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in Neural Networks for a long time because, fundamentally, they are similar to a process controller.
$$ Output = Input \times Weight + Bias $$
It&amp;rsquo;s just a line. For multiple inputs/outputs, the equation is the same, but they are matrices (or tensors).</description></item><item><title>Temperature Control</title><link>/2017/03/27/temperature-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:02:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tom.andrew.wilson@gmail.com (Thomas Wilson)</author><guid>/2017/03/27/temperature-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>Problem: stove-top temperature is poorly controlled resulting in inconsistent cooking times and results.&lt;/p>

Components: water inlet diaphragm valve Tank open to atmosphere (usually covered) Level Indicator with mechanical linkage to diaphragm valve(2) Chain operated stop-check valve Bowl also open to atmosphere S-bend outlet pipe to sewer/septic system Operation During normal operation, the water level in the tank is controlled by feedback from the level indicator to the inlet valve.</description></item><item><title>3x3x3</title><link>/3x3x3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>tom.andrew.wilson@gmail.com (Thomas Wilson)</author><guid>/3x3x3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here is my approach to solving a standard 3x3x3 Rubic&amp;rsquo;s Cube.
