# BLACK BEAN TORTAS WITH COCONUT CHIPOTLE MAYO


     

     






#### yields  4 TORTAS


## ingredients
* 1 cup canned coconut milk 
* 1/3 cup of your favorite chipotle hot sauce 
* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 1 TBL ground chia seeds 
* 1 tsp lemon juice 
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder 
* 1 pinch salt 
* 1 tsp oil 
* 1 yellow onion 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 1 TBL chili powder 
* 3/4 tsp ground cumin 
* 3 cup cooked black beans 
* 1 1/2 cup vegetable broth 
* 1 tsp lime juice 
* Salt to taste 
* 4 crusty rolls, split and toasted 
* Lettuce 
* Sliced tomatoes 
* Sliced red onion 
* Sliced avocado 



## Instructions
0 chop onion

1 First, make the mayo. Throw all those mayo ingredients in your blender or food processor

and run that motherfucker on high for about a minute so everything is good and mixed. Taste

and see if you want more hot sauce. Pour this all in a cup or bowl and store it in the fridge

until you need it. It will thicken in there, just fucking be patient.

2 Next, make the beans. Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Throw in the

onion and sauté it until it starts to look golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, chili

powder, and cumin and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the beans and broth and stir that

shit up. Let it come to a simmer and then turn down the heat real low. Using a potato masher

or big-ass spoon, smash up all those beans as best you can. Think chunky guacamole. Add the

lime juice and then taste. Add some salt or more spices if that’s the kinda shit you’re into.

Now turn off the heat and make a torta.

3 Grab a toasted roll and smear with a bunch of the coconut chipotle mayo. Pile a fuckton of

the beans on the bottom half. In between, add whateverthefuck you want. Lettuce, tomatoes,

red onion, and some avocado are some time-tested choices, but be creative and shit. Serve right

away with some extra hot sauce.



## Modifications
Yeah, chia seeds, like the fucking chia pet. They are rich in omega-3s and full of fiber. If you can’t find them,

flaxseeds are an OK sub.

 Two 15-ounce cans will do if you are in a rush.
