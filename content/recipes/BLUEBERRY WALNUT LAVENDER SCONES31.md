# BLUEBERRY WALNUT LAVENDER SCONES
#### yields 12 SCONES. BEST SERVED THE DAY THEY ARE MADE.

## ingredients
* 1 cup flour
* 1 TBL baking powder
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup walnuts			

# instructions
1 Crank your oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.
2 In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, sugars, and salt. Cut the oil into the
flour using your hands until it all looks kind of grainy and there are no large chunks left. Stir in
the mother lavender.
3 Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the almond milk and vanilla. Mix
it together until it is almost all the way combined but stop short. Fold in the berries and
walnuts but be careful not to overmix.
4 Scoop out the dough in .5-cup measurements and plop onto the baking sheet. Brush with
almond milk and sprinkle with white sugar. Bake until they look a little golden around on the
bottom, 12 to 15 minutes.

# modifications

Can’t find dried lavender? Don’t trek all over town. Just leave it out and add an extra .5 tsp vanilla
extract. We just wanted to give you a chance to be extra fancy.
