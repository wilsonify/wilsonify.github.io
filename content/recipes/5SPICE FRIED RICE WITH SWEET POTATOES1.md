# 5-SPICE FRIED RICE WITH SWEET POTATOES
#### yields 4 AS A SIDE OR YOUR LONELY ASS FOR A COUPLE

## ingredients
* 1 medium sweet potato (¾ to 1 LB)
* 2 tsp neutral-tasting oil
* 2 TBL water
* 1/2 small yellow onion
* 1 carrot carrot
* 1/4 tsp Chinese 5-spice powder
* 1 to 2 clove garlic to 2 clove garlic
* 1 1/2 TBL soy sauce or tamari
* 1 TBL rice vinegar
* 1 tsp chili paste or an Asian-style hot sauce like Sriracha
* 4 cup cooked short-grain brown rice that’s been chilled for a couple hours
* 1 cup bitter greens
* 1/2 cup sliced green onions
* 1 cup frozen green peas, thawed

# instructions
0 chop onion, carrot, and greans no bigger than a quarter
1 Peel the sweet potato and chop into dice-size cubes.
2 In a large wok or skillet, heat 1 tsp of the oil over medium heat. Add the sweet potato
and the water and stir-fry the potato, stirring often. If the potato starts to stick, add a little
more of the water as needed. Cook until the potato is close to tender and browning on some
sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the onion and carrot and cook until the onions are translucent,
about 3 more minutes. Add the 5-spice powder and garlic, mix well, then remove the
vegetables from the pan. Scrape the pan clean cause we aren’t fucking done.
3 In a small glass, mix together the soy sauce, vinegar, and chili paste. Heat the wok back up
over medium heat and add the remaining 1 tsp oil. Throw in the rice and stir-fry until it
begins to warm, 3 to 5 minutes. Drizzle the sauce over the rice, mix well, then add the cooked
vegetables. Stir-fry for a minute so everything is well mixed. Fold in the greens, green onions,
and peas. Turn off the heat and serve immediately.

# modifications

Grapeseed, peanut, or regular sesame oil would be cool.
 Most grocery stores carry this shit with the rest of the spices. It’s a blend of clove, star anise, cinnamon, pepper,
ginger, and fennel seeds. It’s tasty as hell and you should own some. If you can’t find it, you can make your own
blend or just leave it out and tell your grocer to get their shit together.
 We used watercress, but mustard or arugula are fine if you can’t find that weedy looking bastard.
