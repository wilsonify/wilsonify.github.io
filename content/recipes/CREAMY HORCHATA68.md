# CREAMY HORCHATA



#### yields  4 GLASSES


## ingredients
* 1 cup uncooked long-grain brown rice 
* 2/3 cup raw almonds 
* 3 cinnamon stick 
* 4 cup water 
* 1 TBL agave syrup or maple syrup 
* Ice or water 
* Ground cinnamon 



## Instructions
1 Rinse the rice well under cool water. Throw it in a large container with a lid and add the

almonds, cinnamon stick, and water. Let this all soak together overnight or for at least 8

hours.

2 When that soaking is done, dump the whole deal in your blender, water and all, add the

agave, and blend that mess until it’s all smooth. Leave the cinnamon in—don’t worry, that shit

will blend up too. Pour it all through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth to get out the grit.

3 If you are going to serve it right away, add 1 cup ice and blend it again to cool it down. If

not, blend in another .5 cup water and stick it in the fridge. Serve cold with ice cubes and some

cinnamon sprinkled on top because you’re fucking fancy like that.



## Modifications
Brown basmati rice is the best here, but use whatever the fuck kind of brown rice you can find.

 Whatever liquid, syrupy sweetener you got should do.
