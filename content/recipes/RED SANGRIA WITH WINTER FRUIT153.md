* 2 cup sparkling water or club soda

# instructions
1 In a big container or pitcher, stir together the wine, brandy, orange juice, and fruit. (Don’t stop and peel the fruit. Just throw it all in there.) Stick this in the fridge to chill for at least an hour or as long as overnight.
2 When it’s time to get down, add the sparkling water and serve chilled with all the fruit still floating around.

# modifications

Use a red wine that is nice and cheap, but not so superdisgusting that you wouldn’t drink it without fruit. Does the tag say it tastes like it already has some fruit in it? Cool, just grab that shit.
