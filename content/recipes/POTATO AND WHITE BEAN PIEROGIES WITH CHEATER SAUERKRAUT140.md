# Potato and White Bean Pierogies with Cheater Sauerkraut

#### Yields: 24 pierogies — enough for 4–6 people as a side or 10–12 as part of a spread

## Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading  
- 1/4 tsp salt  
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder  
- 1 1/2 to 2 cups warm water  
- 1 tsp olive oil (for dough)  
- 1 lb red or yellow potatoes (about 4 fist-size potatoes)  
- 2 tsp olive oil (for filling)  
- 1/2 large yellow onion  
- 3 cups spinach  
- Salt, to taste  
- 1 can (15 oz) white beans, drained and rinsed  
- 1 clove garlic, minced (or more to taste)  
- 1–2 tbsp lemon juice  
- 1–2 tsp hot sauce (optional)  
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast  

## Instructions

1. **Make the dough**: In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and garlic powder. Add the warm water and olive oil, stirring until a shaggy dough forms. Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth, then cover and let rest while you prepare the filling.  

2. **Prepare the potatoes**: Chop the potatoes into chunks no larger than poker chips. Place in a steamer basket over a pot with a couple inches of water. Cover and steam over medium-low heat until tender, 15–20 minutes.  

3. **Cook the vegetables**: While the potatoes steam, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach, a pinch of salt, and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.  

4. **Make the filling**: In a large bowl, mash the beans into a paste. Add the cooked potatoes and mash until they resemble mashed potatoes. Stir in the onion-spinach mixture, garlic, lemon juice, hot sauce, nutritional yeast, and salt to taste. Adjust seasoning as needed.  

5. **Prepare the dough rounds**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil while you roll out the dough. Divide the rested dough in half. Roll out one half on a floured surface until about tortilla thickness. Cut out 2.5-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter or jar. Repeat with the other half, re-rolling scraps as needed (about 24 rounds total).  

6. **Fill the pierogies**: Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each round. Wet the edges with water, fold over, and press to seal. Crimp edges with a fork. Place assembled pierogies on a floured baking sheet.  

7. **Cook the pierogies**: Working in batches of 6, drop pierogies into the boiling water. Cook until they float and the dough is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Continue until all are cooked.  

8. **Serve**: Enjoy hot with cheater sauerkraut, sour cream, or your favorite toppings.  

## Modifications
- Whole wheat pastry flour can be used, but all-purpose flour gives the best texture.  
- Using canned beans (15 oz, drained and rinsed) saves time compared to cooking from scratch.
