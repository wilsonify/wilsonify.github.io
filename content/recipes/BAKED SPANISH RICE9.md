# instructions
0 chop tomatoes; mince jalapeno
1 Crank your oven to 375°F. Grab a 9 x 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.
2 In a blender or food processor, combine the onion, tomatoes, garlic, jalapeño, and tomato
paste and let that shit run until a smoothish-looking sauce is born, about 30 seconds. You
should get about 2 cup of sauce. Pour that into a medium saucepan, mix in the broth, and let
it come to a simmer over medium heat.
3 While that tomato mixture is heating up, spread the rice over the bottom of the baking dish
and drizzle the oil and salt over the top.
4 When the broth mixture is at a gentle simmer, pour it over the rice, stir it up so everything
is mixed, then cover tightly with foil and put in the oven. Let this bake for 1 hour. Try to not
check on it because every time you do you’ll be letting out precious steam and your rice will be
undercooked as a motherfucker. Just keep the oven at 375°F and you’re all good.
5 After 1 hour, pull out the baking dish and fluff the rice around with a fork so everything is
mixed back in. If the rice isn’t all the way cooked, add another .25 cup broth or water, cover, and
bake it for another 10 minutes or so. Fold in the corn, peas, lime juice, and cilantro and mix
well. Add a pinch more salt if you need it. Serve right away.

These can be fresh or thawed frozen stuff; not a fucking deal breaker here.
