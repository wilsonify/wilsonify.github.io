# BREAKFAST GREENS



#### yields  2 TO 4 AS A SIDE


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 tsp maple syrup or agave syrup 
* 1 tsp tomato paste 
* 1 tsp liquid smoke 
* 2 tsp soy sauce 
* 2 tsp olive or grapeseed oil 
* 8 ounces tempeh 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1 1/2 tsp seasoning blend 
* 1 bunch kale 
* 2 TBL lemon juice 



## Instructions
0 mince garlic; cut kale into 2-inch strips (about 7 cup)

1 In a small glass, mix together the broth, maple syrup, tomato paste, liquid smoke, and 1

tsp of the soy sauce and set that shit aside.

2 Heat the oil in a big wok or skillet over medium heat. Crumble in the tempeh in bite-size

pieces and sauté it around until it starts to brown in some places, 2 to 3 minutes. Now pour

that broth mixture all over and let it cook for about 15 seconds. Add the garlic and seasoning

blend and cook for another 30 seconds. Almost done.

3 Now we get to the greens. Pile those motherfuckers on top of the tempeh, pour in the

lemon juice and remaining 1 tsp soy sauce, and stir everything around with the tempeh. It

will look like too much kale but respect the process, damn. Let the kale cook down for about a

minute or two—you want it nice and wilted, not cooked to death. Serve right away.
