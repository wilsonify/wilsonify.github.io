		<instructions>1 Warm up a large skillet with a lid over medium heat. Add the cabbage and enough water for it to be about halfway submerged. Fold in the bay leaves, garlic, vinegar, sugar, and salt and bring that shit to a simmer.
2 Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and let that that fucker simmer until the cabbage gets kinda wilty, about 15 minutes. Uncover, increase the heat to medium, and simmer until the cabbage is all cooked through and most of the liquid is evaporated, about 15 minutes longer. If it’s all cooked but there’s still some water left, just drain that excess shit off, no stress.
3 Stir in the dill, discard the bay leaves, and stick the sauerkraut in the fridge until it cools down. Taste and add more garlic, dill, salt, or vinegar, whatever you think it needs to taste right. You can make this fiberful motherfucker a couple days in advice. Serve in a big-ass bowl alongside some pierogies and enjoy that shit.</instructions>
		<modifications>This shit is with the rest of the spices. Promise.
 Optional, but that is some deliciousness we wouldn’t pass over. Also, dill can help soothe some of the cabbage’s gassier tendencies. Just sayin’.
If you want to do a lot of the work ahead of time, make the dumplings all the way until the dough is still raw but the pierogies are all sealed. Spray them with some oil, cover them with plastic wrap, and fucking freeze them in a single layer on a baking sheet. This keeps those bastards from sticking together. When they’re all frozen, dump them into a plastic bag or some Tupperware and store in the freezer for up to 3 months. BOOM. Tasty fucking food as an entrée or appetizer whenever the hell you want. When you’re ready to get down, just boil them for an extra minute or two. Or if you’re just spreading out the work, you could make the filling a day or two ahead of time. It keeps in the fridge for a couple days.</modifications>
