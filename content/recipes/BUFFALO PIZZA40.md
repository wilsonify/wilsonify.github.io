<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>0 chop garlic, and avacado<br>1 Make the pizza dough through step 3. While that yeasty beast is rising, make all your toppings and crank up the oven to 475°F. Yeah, your kitchen is going to be hot as fuck, but you’re getting pizza out of it. Fair trade.<br>2 Now get that buffalo tempeh going: In a small glass, mix together the flour and vinegar until you get a paste. Slowly whisk in that hot sauce and try to minimize the chunks. Set that spicy son of a bitch aside.<br>3 Warm up the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the crumbled tempeh and onion and sauté that shit around until they both look a little golden in some spots, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and then pour over the hot sauce mixture. Stir this all around and let it cook for about 1 minute so that the tempeh absorbs a little bit of the sauce, then turn that heat right off. Yeah, your whole place smells like hot sauce now. YOU’RE FUCKING WELCOME.<br>4 To make the white sauce: Throw the flour, oil, milk, garlic, salt, and nutritional yeast in a blender and run that fucker until the garlic is all chopped up and the sauce looks mostly smooth. Pour all of that into a small saucepan and add the dried herbs. Warm it all up over medium heat, whisking it every few minutes until that shit starts to thicken up, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the lemon juice and remove from the heat.<br>5 Roll out one ball of dough using the instructions. Spread a bunch of the white sauce down over your pizza-shaped dough, and pile on about half the buffaloed tempeh, leaving about 1 inch around the edges as the crust. Do the same shit with the rest of the dough, white sauce, and tempeh.<br>6 Brush those crusts with olive oil, put those pies on a baking sheet, and bake until the crusts look golden, 10 to 12 minutes.<br>7 While the pizzas are baking, set up the toppings: Mix up the celery and avocado in a small bowl with the lemon juice and salt.<br>8 When the pizzas are done, sprinkle the celery-avocado mixture all over the pies and drizzle on some more of the white sauce if you have some left. You can toss on some chopped chives if you’re feeling fancy but that shit isn’t necessary. Serve right away with some extra hot sauce on the side.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Frank’s RedHot is traditional, but do whatever basic vinegar red hot sauce you can find at the store.<br> Just crumble this fermented fucker right into the pan into pieces no bigger than a dime. Not sure what tempeh is?<br> WTF?<br> Celery seed is in the spice aisle with the other spices. We fucking promise. It’s been there forever. Not some new, weird trendy shit you have to hunt down. It’s old school.</p></div></div>
