# Apple-Onion Focaccia

#### Yields 1 Loaf of Bread

## Ingredients
- 2 tsp plus 2 TBL olive oil
- 1 TBL fresh thyme or rosemary
- Everyday Pizza Dough
- 1 TBL unsweetened nondairy milk of your choice

- Balsamic Dipping Sauce (optional)
  - 3 TBL balsamic vinegar
  - Fresh parsley
  - 1 pinch of red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 450°F. Grease a rimmed baking sheet.

2. In a medium skillet, heat 1 tsp of olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onions until brown and delicious, about 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the onions to a plate.

3. Add another 1 tsp of olive oil to the same pan. Cook the apple slices over medium heat with lemon juice and thyme until slightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.

4. On a well-floured surface, shape the dough into a 4 x 10-inch rectangle, approximately an inch thick. Place it on the greased baking sheet. Dimple the top of the bread with your fingertips. Mix the remaining 2 TBL of olive oil with the milk and brush it over the dough.

5. Scatter half of the sautéed onions over the bread, dimple it a bit more, and arrange the apple slices in a single layer. Feel free to make a creative pattern. Scatter the remaining onions and bake until the bread is golden, 15 to 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

6. For the dipping sauce, mix all the sauce ingredients on a low-rimmed plate or bowl.

## Modifications

Use Granny Smith, Pink Lady, or any apple variety you enjoy.
