# instructions
0 chop onion
1 Warm the oven to 425°F. Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
2 Make the burgers: Add the beans to a large bowl and mash those  ers up with a potato masher or large spoon until a sorta paste forms. A couple of larger bean chunks are cool. Add the zucchini, onion, garlic, oil, soy sauce or tamari, liquid smoke, and seasoning blend and mix until it’s all distributed. Fold in the bread crumbs and stir that    around until there are no dry patches and everything is uniform. This should feel slightly sticky and hold nicely when you form it into a ball. If it is too wet, add more bread crumbs. Too dry? Add some  oil. Stop looking for excuses why you’re a bad cook. Taste and add more spices and whatever until it tastes good enough to you. Can’t do that    with ground beef.
3 Form the mixture into 12 patties if you are making sliders or 6 patties if you are making regular burgers. Whateverthe  you wanna do. Place them on the baking sheet, spray them lightly with oil, and bake, flipping halfway, until they look a little golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. If you’re doing full-size burgers you might need to let them go 10 extra minutes.
4 While the burgers are baking, make the slaw: In a medium bowl, combine the cabbage, carrot, green onions, and salt. Get your hands in there and kinda massage the salt into the cabbage. This will help your slaw soften up faster so that your whole burger is on point. Add the vinegar, oil, and celery seed and stir that    up so everything is coated. Stick that    in the fridge to chill until go-time.
5 To assemble the burgers, coat the patties with BBQ sauce and smear a good amount on both sides of the buns. There’s no such thing as too much BBQ sauce. Pile a good amount of slaw right on top of that saucyass patty and you’re ready to get down. Serve within an hour of assembling so that your bun isn’t a sad soggy pile of mush.

# modifications

Two 15-ounce cans, drained and rinsed, are totally fine. Black beans would be a good sub too.
 Calm the   down, we explain that   .
 Any kind of regular bread crumbs you have are fine. Got nothing? Just toast up some bread until it is almost burnt looking and real dry, then grate it or put it in a food processor to get some tiny  crumbs. They help soak up all the liquid, so DO NOT leave this    out.
 Clueless?
