# PEACH-MINT SUN TEA

## ingredients
* 4 cup cold water
* 4 bags of your favorite black tea
* 2 ripe peaches
* 2 TBL lemon juice
* 10 mint leaves, plus mint sprigs for garnish
* 2 tsp agave or maple syrup (Optional)
* Ice


## Instructions
0. chop peaches into chunks

1 Place the water and tea bags in a large container with a lid and set that fucker in the sun for 3

to 5 hours. No sunny spots where you stay? Just throw it in the fridge or leave it on the

counter; it will still work.

2 Once the tea has steeped, get to making your drinks. Throw the peaches in a blender with

the lemon juice, mint, and agave (if using). Add the tea and run that shit until everything is

mixed and there aren’t any peach chunks flying around. Taste and add more sweetener if you

need it.

3 Pour over ice and serve with a sprig of mint in each glass. If you have a porch, go out there

and enjoy this shit while you judge the neighbors.



## Modifications
Only add this if your peaches aren’t super ripe.
