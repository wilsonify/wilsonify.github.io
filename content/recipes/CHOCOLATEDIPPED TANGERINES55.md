# CHOCOLATE-DIPPED TANGERINES



#### yields  30 SLICES, DEPENDING ON YOUR CITRUS


## ingredients
* 5 or 6 tangerines, clementines, or tiny oranges of any kind 
* 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips 
* 1 tsp butter 
* 1/2 tsp sea salt 



## Instructions
1 Peel the fruit and break them up into segments. Try to get all that white pith off because

that    will taste bitter. Lay the segments on a baking sheet lined with wax paper in some

kind of order.

2 Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or the microwave (see this page for how). Add the

butter to the chocolate chips and stir until everything is melted and mixed together. Turn

off the heat.

3 Dip half a citrus segment into the melted chocolate mixture and lay it flat on the baking

sheet. Repeat with remaining segments. Sprinkle the chocolate dipped ends with some sea salt

to dazzle mother ers.

4 Place the baking sheet in a cool area and let the chocolate firm up before serving, 15 to 45

minutes depending on the temperature in your pad. You can stick this in the fridge if you are in

a rush.
