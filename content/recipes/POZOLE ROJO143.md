# POZOLE ROJO

#### yields  6 HUNGRY PEOPLE, NO FUCKING PROBLEM

## ingredients
* 5 large dried chiles
* 2 cup warm water
* 1 large onion
* 5 clove garlic
* 1 zucchini
* 2 TBL unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 8 ounces tempeh
* 2 tsp soy sauce or tamari
* 1 can (29 ounces) hominy
* 1 TBL dried oregano
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* ¼ tsp salt
* 5 cup vegetable broth
* 1 tsp maple syrup or other liquid sweetener
* 2 tsp lime juice

# Toppings
* Sliced cabbage
* sliced green onions
* radishes cut into matchsticks
* cilantro
* avocado
* lime wedges

# instructions
1 Grab a big pot or griddle and toast the dried chiles on both sides until they get a little
bendy and soft, about 2 minutes. Don’t let these fuckers burn. Stay focused. When they are all
good, throw them in a bowl with the warm water and let them soak for 15 to 20 minutes.

2 While that’s going down, chop up the onion, garlic, and zucchini. When the chiles are nice
and rehydrated take them out of the water but hold on to the water. Cut off the chile tops,
remove the seeds, and chop them all up. Throw them in a blender or food processor with the
water they were soaked in, the garlic, and cocoa powder, and run it until the chile-garlic paste
looks all mashed up with no big chunks left.

3 Heat up the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté that shit for
2 minutes. Grab the tempeh and crumble that fucker right into the pot in dime- and nickel-
size chunks and sauté until both the onion and tempeh start to brown, about 3 more minutes.
Add soy sauce for a little flavor. Next, add the zucchini, hominy, oregano, cumin, and salt. Stir
that all together and then add the chile-garlic paste you made earlier. Toss that all around so
that everything is well coated and then add the broth. Cover that bastard and let it simmer for
15 to 20 minutes to get all the flavors to combine. Next add the maple syrup and lime juice.
Taste that fucker and adjust the spices to the way you want it.

4 Serve hot with your favorite toppings.

# modifications

Guajillo, ancho, whateverthefuck kind of big chiles you can find hanging at the end of the spice aisle.
 Yeah, the same shit you use to make brownies.
 Hominy is made by soaking maize kernels in a lime mixture to soften their hulls, causing them to swell up. It
is fucking awesome. You can buy hominy already cooked in cans near the beans and salsa at the store, or you can
find it dried and cook it yourself like the package says.
