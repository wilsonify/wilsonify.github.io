# instructions
0 chop onion and celery
1 Grab a large soup pot and heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery
and sauté until the onion starts to look golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the potato,
rosemary, garlic, pepper flakes, and bay leaf. Cook for another 30 seconds to get the garlic
going. Add the diced tomatoes and lentils and give it another 30 seconds.
2 Now, pour in all the broth and let that motherfucker come to a simmer. Reduce the heat and
let that go at a gentle pace until the lentils are almost cooked but the potato is tender, about
15 minutes. Next, add the salt, pasta, and cabbage (if using kale, don’t add it yet) and keep the
pot gently simmering until the pasta is cooked all the way, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on your
pasta. (If you are using kale, fold it into the pot after the pasta is all cooked and let that pot
simmer for 2 more minutes.)
3 Add the vinegar and lemon juice, stir well, and remove from the heat. Fold in the parsley and
basil and let the pot sit for a minute or two. Taste to see whateverthefuck else it might need,
like pepper or more rosemary to taste. Pull out the bay leaf and serve right away.

# modifications

If tomatoes are in season and for some fucking reason you are making this soup, then sub in 3 fist-size tomatoes,
chopped.
