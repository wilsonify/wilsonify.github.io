# instructions
1 Crank your oven up to 450°F. Grease a rimmed baking sheet so your bread doesn’t stick.
2 In a medium skillet, heat up 1 tsp of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté those  ers around until they look kinda brown and delicious, 5 to 7 minutes. Scrape the onion out of the pan onto a plate.
3 Throw another 1 tsp olive oil into the same pan. Add the apple slices and cook them over medium heat. Add the lemon juice and thyme and sauté until the apple slices are slightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes total. Remove from the heat, cuz it’s dough time.
4 On a well-floured surface, shape your dough into a 4 x 10-inch rectangle about an inch or so thick. Don’t pull out a  ruler, just eyeball that   . Place that on your super greased-up baking sheet. Take your fingertips and dimple the top of the bread like you’re a phantom of the opera, or some    like that, playing the organ in a dramatic way. You know what the   we’re saying. Mix the remaining 2 TBL of olive oil with the milk and brush this all over the dough.
5 Scatter half the onions all over the bread, dimple that    a little more, and then lay down all the apple slices in a single layer. Make a cool or dumb pattern, spell out  , whatever. Scatter on the rest of the onions and then throw that    in the oven. Bake until the bread looks nice and golden, 15 to 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temp.
6 If you are making the dipping sauce, just mix all the ingredients together on a low-rimmed plate or bowl and get to  dipping.
