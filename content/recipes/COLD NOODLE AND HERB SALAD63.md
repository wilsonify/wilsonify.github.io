# COLD NOODLE AND HERB SALAD
#### yields 4 PEOPLE AS A MAIN, 6 TO 8 AS A SIDE
## ingredients
* 2 clove garlic

* 1/3 cup rice vinegar

* 3 TBL toasted sesame oil

* 1 TBL lemon or lime juice

* 2 tsp Sriracha-style hot sauce

* 1 tsp agave syrup or your favorite liquid sweetener

* 1 LB thin noodles, cooked

* 2 carrots

* 1 red bell pepper

* 1/2 medium cucumber

* 1 1/2 cup shelled edamame

* 1/2 cup fresh basil

* 1/2 cup cilantro

* 2 TBL toasted sesame seeds *optional*


# instructions
0 chop garlic; cut carrots, bell pepper, cucumber into matchsticks.
1 First make the dressing: Throw the green onions, garlic, vinegar, sesame oil, lemon juice, Sriracha, and agave into a blender or food processor and let that shit run until everything looks mixed up and the green onions are in little bits. You don’t fucking need it to be silky smooth, so don’t go fucking crazy. Like 15 to 30 seconds max. Then just set aside. Or you can mince up the green onions and garlic by hand and mix all the shit together in a jar. Whatever you’re about.
2 Put the salad together: In a large bowl, combine the noodles, carrots, bell pepper, cucumber, and edamame. Pour in the dressing and mix until everything looks coated and all the veggies are mingling with the noodles. Fold in the basil, cilantro, and sesame seeds (if using). Cover and set it in the fridge to chill for at least an hour before serving.

# modifications

Scallions and green onions are the same damn thing. We just called them “scallions” in the name of the dressing cause it sounds badass, but now you know the truth.
 Soba, udon, or regular ol’ spaghetti would work just fine here. Use what you’ve got. Check out our pasta breakdown.
 See House Rules.
 Optional, but sesame seeds kinda class up the dish. People love tiny-ass seeds; details like that makes them feel like their food is special. Not a deal breaker if you don’t have them though. Need help toasting?
