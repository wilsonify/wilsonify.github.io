# HOUSE MARINARA



#### yields  4 cup


## ingredients
* 1/2 large onion 
* 1 carrot 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* 1 tsp dried thyme 
* 1 pinch of red pepper flakes 
* 1 can (28 ounces) whole tomatoes 
* Salt 



## Instructions
1 Chop up the onion. Dice up the carrot into pieces about the size of a pea. Mince the garlic

up small. You can do this shit in your sleep.

2 Heat the oil in a medium soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté it until

begins to look golden in some places, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the carrot and cook for another 2

minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes. This should be smelling fucking choice

right now.

3 Open the can of tomatoes, grab some whole tomatoes, and smash them in your fists like a

fucked up stress ball. Squeeze them into a bunch of pieces and stir them into the pot as you go.

Keep doing this until all the tomatoes are smashed up, then add ¾ cup of the juice from the

can to the pot. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer this uncovered for 25 to 30

minutes, until all the tomatoes are broken down. Taste and add more garlic, thyme, salt, or

whatever the fuck you think it needs.

4 If you like a smoother sauce, throw that shit in the blender or use an immersion blender to

get rid of some of the chunks. The sauce will keep in the fridge for a week.



## Modifications
White, yellow, or sweet will do. Whatever is on sale.

 Or you could use 5 clove of roasted garlic to mix it up.

 Make sure there isn’t a shitton of salt or any other seasoning in there.
