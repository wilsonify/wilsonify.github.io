# BANANA AND COCONUT POPS


     

     






#### yields  5 cup FILLING, ENOUGH FOR 10 POPS


## ingredients
* 6 ripe bananas 
* 1 cup canned coconut milk 
* 1 1/2 cup nondairy yogurt 
* 3 TBL maple syrup or agave syrup 
* 2 TBL orange juice 
* 1 TBL ground cinnamon 
* 2 tsp vanilla extract 



## Instructions
1 Throw everything into a blender and give it a goddamn whirl until there are no chunks of banana left in there and everything looks smooth.

2 Pour this into your popsicle molds and stick in the freezer for about 40 minutes. If you don’t have a mold with built-in sticks, after 40 minutes, take out your pop molds and then push popsicle sticks in. Freezing these  ers a little bit first helps make sure you won’t push the stick all the way through and end up with a slushie kebab that falls on the floor right away. Learn from our messy-ass mistakes. Please. If you have those fancy popsicle molds that stop this from happening, then congratulations.

3 Freeze until completely frozen. Yeah, we have to say that    because people are impatient. Then kick back with one whenever life gets too hot to handle. They will keep for at least a month in the freezer.

We used coconut yogurt to keep that    on theme, but use whatever you can find like almond or soy. Just get plain or vanilla. None of that blueberry and banana bull  . Use some damn sense.
