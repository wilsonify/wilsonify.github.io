Open up the can and scoop out all the thick white cream on the surface and put it in the<br>chilled bowl. Leave that clearish liquid in the can and use it for a smoothie or something later.<br>You don’t need that shit now. Sift in the powdered sugar so that there aren’t any chunks and<br>add the vanilla.<br>3 Now beat the fuck out of it on medium-high speed until it starts looking all fluffy and<br>whipped, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve right away. It tastes good for a couple days, but it loses some of<br>its airiness the longer it sits.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Put that shit in the fridge the day before so you know it’s cold enough. This is not a 30-minute chill kinda<br>situation. You want to give everything time to get cold and for the fat to separate from the coconut water in there.<br>Fuck it—just store a bunch of cans in the fridge so you’re always ready.</p></div></div>
