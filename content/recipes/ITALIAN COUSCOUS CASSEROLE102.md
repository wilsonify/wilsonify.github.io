# ITALIAN COUSCOUS CASSEROLE



#### yields  6 PEOPLE, NO FUCKING PROBLEM


## ingredients
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 medium eggplant, unpeeled, cut into chunks (about 3 cup) 
* 1 medium yellow onion 
* 1 medium yellow squash or zucchini, shredded (about 1.5 cup) 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 2 tsp dried thyme 
* 2 tsp dried basil 
* 0.25 teapsoon red pepper flakes (optional)
* 2 cup spinach 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 3 cup cooked couscous (1.25 cup uncooked) 
* Blender Red Sauce 
* 2 TBL red wine vinegar 
* 2 TBL lemon juice 
* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast 
* fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)



## Instructions
0 chop onion

1 Crank up the oven to 375°F. Grease a 9 x 9 x 3-inch baking dish (or smaller as long as it is at least 3 inches deep).

2 In a large wok or skillet, warm up the olive oil over medium-high heat. Throw the eggplant and onion into the pan and sauté until the onion starts looking a little translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the squash, garlic, thyme, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using) and sauté for 2 more minutes. Fold in the spinach, salt, couscous, red sauce, vinegar, and lemon juice. Sauté for another minute or two to wilt the spinach. Remove from the heat and stir in the nutritional yeast. Taste and add more garlic or whatever the fuck you think it needs.

3 Scrape the mixture into the baking dish. Cover it with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until the edges look golden and tasty as hell, about 15 minutes longer. Serve right away with some fresh basil or parsley on top so it looks pro.
