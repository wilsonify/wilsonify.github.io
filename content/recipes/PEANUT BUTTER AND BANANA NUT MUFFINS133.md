# PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA NUT MUFFINS

#### yields  12 STANDARD MUFFINS

## ingredients
* 2 cup whole wheat pastry or all-purpose flour 
* 1 TBL baking powder 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 
* 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 
* 3/4 cup plain almond or other nondairy milk 
* 1 1/2 cup mashed ripe banana 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 1/2 cup walnuts or peanuts 

## Instructions

1 Heat your oven to 375°F. Grease your muffin tin or use paper muffin liners.

2 In a big bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3 Now in a smaller bowl, mix together the peanut butter and brown sugar until it looks kinda creamy. 

Stir in the milk, banana, and vanilla until everything is mixed up.

4 Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until just combined. 

If you mix it up too much, your muffins will be tough. 

Fold in the nuts now if you are using them.

5 Scoop the batter into the muffin cup. 

This yields a lot of batter, so fill to the brim. 

Bake until a toothpick comes out clean when poked in the center of a muffin, 18 to 22 minutes. 

Take them out of the tin and let cool for at least 15 minutes before eating.

## Modifications
This usually takes about 3 regular-size bananas.

You could sub .5 cup chocolate chips in here if you want to drop any illusions that these aren’t dessert.
