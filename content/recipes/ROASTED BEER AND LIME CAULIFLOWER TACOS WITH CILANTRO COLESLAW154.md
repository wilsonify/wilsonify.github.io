1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Grab a rimmed baking sheet.

2 Chop the cauliflower into small florets no bigger than a quarter. In a saucepan, warm the

beer, broth, lime juice, tamari, hot sauce, and garlic over medium heat. Add the cauliflower and

simmer for about 1.5 minutes. Drain.

3 Toss the spices, salt, and olive oil together in a large bowl. Add the cauliflower and onion

stirring halfway, about 20 minutes.

pile them high with the cauliflower filling, slices of avocado, some of the slaw, and top with

plenty of salsa.
