<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Throw everything into a blender and give it a goddamn whirl until there are no chunks of banana left in there and everything looks smooth.<br>2 Pour this into your popsicle molds and stick in the freezer for about 40 minutes. If you don’t have a mold with built-in sticks, after 40 minutes, take out your pop molds and then push popsicle sticks in. Freezing these fuckers a little bit first helps make sure you won’t push the stick all the way through and end up with a slushie kebab that falls on the floor right away. Learn from our messy-ass mistakes. Please. If you have those fancy popsicle molds that stop this from happening, then congratufuckinglations.<br>3 Freeze until completely frozen. Yeah, we have to say that shit because people are impatient. Then kick back with one whenever life gets too hot to handle. They will keep for at least a month in the freezer.<br>We used coconut yogurt to keep that shit on theme, but use whatever you can find like almond or soy. Just get plain or vanilla. None of that blueberry and banana bullshit. Use some damn sense.</p></div></div></div>
