# instructions
0 Chop apple and celery into bite-size pieces; chop walnuts and cilantro
1 Make the dressing: In a medium glass, mix together the yogurt, lime juice, and vinegar until everything is evenly distributed. Throw in the garlic, curry powder, hot sauce, and salt and keep stirring until everything is nice and yellow and there aren’t any secret clumps of curry powder or hot sauce hiding around in there. Set that    in the fridge.
2 Now get your tempeh on: Place a steamer insert and a couple inches of water in a small pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the tempeh, cover, and steam until it starts to smell kinda nutty, about 10 minutes. Dump it into a large bowl, sprinkle with the soy sauce or tamari, and stir so it gets kinda mixed up. Let it cool while you chop up your veggies.
3 Add the quinoa, apple, celery, carrot, and walnuts to the bowl with the tempeh and mix it all together. Add all of the dressing and the cilantro and keep mixing until everything is coated and looking on point. Taste and add more hot sauce, lime juice, salt, whatever you think might take it up to your level for flavor.
4 Serve right away or let it chill in the fridge until cold, about an hour.

# modifications

This is 6 ounces of yogurt or one little plastic cup thing at the store. We used plain coconut yogurt, but use whatever kind your store stocks.
 
 About ¾ cup uncooked quinoa. No  idea beyond that?
 If you hate walnuts, just sub in what kind of nuts you like or keep in the back of your freezer. Pecans, cashews, and almonds would all be legit. Need help getting toasted?
