# PUMPKIN FRENCH TOAST CASSEROLE



#### yields  9 X 13-INCH PAN, ENOUGH FOR 6 TO 8 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 1 large crusty loaf of stale bread 
* 3 TBL ground flaxseed 
* 2 cup nondairy milk 
* 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice 
* 1 1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree 
* 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 
* 1 TBL vanilla extract 
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon 
* 1 tsp ground ginger 
* 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg 
* 1/3 cup nutritional yeast 
* Spray oil 



## Instructions
1 Heat up the oven to 375°F. Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.

2 Cut up the bread into bite-size pieces about the size of a quarter and throw them into the biggest bowl you’ve got. You want around 12 cup.

3 In a medium glass, mix together the ground flaxseed, milk, and vinegar and set aside.

4 In a large measuring glass (or blender if you don’t mind cleaning that shit), mix together the pumpkin, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg until it looks smooth. Stir in the milk mixture until everything is all combined. Pour this over the bread until it all looks coated, sprinkle in the nutritional yeast, and stir a couple more times so it looks like all that shit is nice and mixed up.

5 Pour the bread mixture into the baking dish in a sort of even layer and spray the top with a little oil. Cover it with foil, and throw that son of a bitch in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, then take off the foil and bake until the top looks sorta golden, another 15 to 20 minutes. Let it cool for a few minutes before you dish the hot fucker up.

6 Serve warm with maple syrup and some more cinnamon for sprinkling. Baristas got nothing on this shit.



## Modifications
We like sourdough, but you could use French or whatever the fuck you’ve got. You want it to be stale though, so it doesn’t get really fucking soggy as it bakes. Eat the fresh stuff and wait until you have some old-ass bread to make this.

 Not pumpkin pie mix; that shit shouldn’t exist. Buy a 15-ounce can of plain pumpkin puree (or steam and puree some shit yourself).

 WTF?
