<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>0 chop onion, carrot, jalapeno(seeded) the size of peas; peel ginger<br>1 Make the filling: Grab a large skillet or wok and heat up the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and carrots and sauté until they start to get a little golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the split peas and green peas (no need to thaw the green peas, just throw those fuckers in frozen) and stir it up. Now add the curry powder, cumin, coriander, and cayenne and sauté for about 30 seconds or until your kitchen smells like a goddamn restaurant. Throw in the spinach, garlic, ginger, and soy sauce or tamari and keep cooking until the spinach starts wilting, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and remove from the heat.<br>2 Now it’s time to make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, curry powder, and salt. Make a well in the center of that and pour in the coconut milk. Stir that all together until everything is combined into a shaggy dough. If you need more liquid add a TBL or two of coconut milk to fix that shit, up to .25 cup. Shape it up into a nice ball. You can make the dough the night before and just stick it in the fridge in a plastic bag. That’s day-old dough in the photo. #realtalk<br>3 Now, to make some fucking pies. Heat your oven up to 375°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.<br>4 Cut the ball of dough in half and throw half of it onto a well-floured surface. Roll it out into an oval shape about ⅛ inch thick. Now grab a biscuit cutter, bowl, or mug about twice the size you want your pies and cut out a bunch of rounds. We like to use a 3.5-inch bowl, but you do you. Cover about half of one round with a good amount of filling and leave about a finger’s width around the edge, cause, you know you’ve got to close that shit. Wet your fingers (with water, not spit, unless you are fucking disgusting) and run them around the edge to help them stick shut. Fold the dough over the filling, taco style, so you have a tasty as fuck half-moon. Press down the edge with your finger to seal it or use a fork so that you get those crimpy lines that people fucking love. Put the hand pie on the baking sheet and cut two or three tiny slits in the top as vents. Keep making pies until you run out of dough or filling.<br>5 Spray the tops with a little oil and pop them in the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges and bottoms start to look a little brown (we know that the yellow color of the dough makes that shit a little difficult, but just look closer).<br>6 While the pies are baking, make the sauce: Throw the ginger, jalapeño, mint, cilantro, lemon juice, water, and salt together in a blender or food processor and run that shit until a kind of paste/sauce hybrid comes together. Add a little more water if you want it saucier. Done.<br>7 Serve the sauce along with the hot hand pies. People will ask you where the fuck you order them from. Trust.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>No clue how to cook these sunshiny fuckers? See Basic Pot of Beans.<br> Can’t find it/don’t want to fucking buy coriander? Just use more cumin instead.<br> You can use all whole wheat or all-purpose if that’s all you’ve got. Not a big deal.<br> Don’t go measuring this shit, just start with a piece of ginger that is about the same size and thickness as your thumb. If you know that you’ve got a big-ass thumb, size down.<br> Throwing in a bunch of mint stems will make this sauce bitter as hell so take a minute to pull off all the leaves one by one. Cilantro stems taste just like the leaves, so you can be reckless as fuck while measuring this shit out. Stems and leaves, whatever. Cilantro is chill like that.</p></div></div>
