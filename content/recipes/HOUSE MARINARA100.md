<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Chop up the onion. Dice up the carrot into pieces about the size of a pea. Mince the garlic<br>up small. You can do this shit in your sleep.<br>2 Heat the oil in a medium soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté it until<br>begins to look golden in some places, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the carrot and cook for another 2<br>minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes. This should be smelling fucking choice<br>right now.<br>3 Open the can of tomatoes, grab some whole tomatoes, and smash them in your fists like a<br>fucked up stress ball. Squeeze them into a bunch of pieces and stir them into the pot as you go.<br>Keep doing this until all the tomatoes are smashed up, then add ¾ cup of the juice from the<br>can to the pot. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer this uncovered for 25 to 30<br>minutes, until all the tomatoes are broken down. Taste and add more garlic, thyme, salt, or<br>whatever the fuck you think it needs.<br>4 If you like a smoother sauce, throw that shit in the blender or use an immersion blender to<br>get rid of some of the chunks. The sauce will keep in the fridge for a week.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>White, yellow, or sweet will do. Whatever is on sale.<br> Or you could use 5 clove of roasted garlic to mix it up.<br> Make sure there isn’t a shitton of salt or any other seasoning in there.</p></div></div>
