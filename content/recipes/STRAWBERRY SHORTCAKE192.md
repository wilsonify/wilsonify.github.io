# instructions
1 Make the filling: Chop the strawberries up into pieces the size of a button and throw them
in a bowl. If your strawberries are super ripe and taste dope as fuck, then add just 2
TBL of sugar. Otherwise add the 4 TBL and curse your shitty produce. Stir that
all together and let it chill while you make everything else.
2 Crank your oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3 For the biscuits: Sift together the flours, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Make a crater in
the middle and add the coconut milk and vanilla. Stir that all together until everything is
combined into a shaggy dough. If you need more liquid, add a TBL or two of coconut
milk to fix that shit.
4 Throw the dough onto a countertop with some flour on it. Pat it into a roughly 8 x 5-inch
rectangle about 1.5 inches thick. Don’t overwork the dough and make it tough. DON’T.
Using a biscuit cutter or open end of a glass, cut out all the motherfucking biscuits you can.
Aim for 8. Put them on the baking sheet and bake until the bottoms are golden, 12 to 15
minutes. Let them cool for a minute before you go to town.
5 To assemble the shortcakes, cut the biscuits in half like 2 layers of a cake. Layer the
strawberry filling on the bottom half, add a scoop of whipped cream, and put the top half of the
biscuit back on. Add another layer of strawberries and whipped cream on top and serve right
away.

# modifications

Double the whipped cream recipe if you are serving all the biscuits at the same time.
