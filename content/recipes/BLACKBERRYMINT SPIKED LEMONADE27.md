# BLACKBERRY-MINT SPIKED LEMONADE
#### yields 6 cup
## ingredients
* 2 lemons into chunks lemons into chunks
* 15 large mint leaves
0.25 to .5 cup sugar
* 2 cup fresh or frozen blackberries* 2 cup fresh or frozen blackberries* 2 cup fresh or frozen blackberries
* 3/4 cup bourbon


# instructions
0 chop lemons
1 Throw the lemon chunks, mint, .25 cup sugar, blackberries, and water into the blender and let it go until everything is chopped the fuck up, about 1 minute. Use a fine-mesh strainer/sieve or some cheesecloth to strain out all the chunky bits when you pour it into a pitcher. Mix in the bourbon and taste that shit. Add the rest of the sugar if your blackberries aren’t helping sweeten that fucker up as much as they should.
2 Serve it up cold or over ice and get ready for some adult-level Kool-Aid mouth. OH YEAH.

# modifications

The amount of sugar you add will depend on how sweet your berries are. Try the lower amount first and then up that shit if it still tastes too tart to you.
 Optional, but please.
Don’t water down your punch by dumping a shitload of ice cubes in there. Those little bastards will melt quick and dilute your drink. Instead, add frozen fruit to make that shit look classy. A cheaper option is to freeze a couple inches of water in your Bundt pan (see House Rules) and stick that ice ring in your punch bowl. That shit will melt much slower than cubes and look way more badass.
