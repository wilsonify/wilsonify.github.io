# SHREDDED CARROT AND APPLE MUFFINS

#### yields  12 STANDARD MUFFINS



## Ingredients
* lemon juice
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 1/2 cup nuts like walnuts or almonds (optional as fuck) 


## Instructions
1 Heat your oven to 375°F. Grab a muffin tin and grease that fucker up or throw in some

muffin liners.

2 In a big bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a

smaller bowl, stir together the almond milk, carrots, apple, oil, lemon juice, and vanilla until

everything is pretty well combined. See any big-ass globs of carrots? Keep stirring.

3 Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and stir until just combined. If you mix it

up too much, your muffins will be tough and sad. Don’t fuck this up after you did all that

grating. Fold in the nuts now if you are using them.

4 Scoop the batter into the muffin cup and bake until a toothpick comes out clean when

poked in the center of a muffin, 18 to 20 minutes. Take them out of the tin to cool for at least

15 minutes before eating.



## Modifications
About 3 medium carrots

 About 1 small apple. Just use whatever kind you would normally eat.
