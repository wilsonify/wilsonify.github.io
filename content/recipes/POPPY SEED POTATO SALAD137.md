		<instructions>0 chop celery
1 Make the dressing: In a blender or food processor, combine the oil, vinegars, shallot, and mustard and run until that onion is fucking invisible. No blender? Just chop that shit up extra tiny. Stir in the poppy seeds and set aside.
2 Make the salad: Chop the potatoes into big, bite-size pieces. If they’re really tiny you can just leave them whole. Boil some water in a large pot, add a pinch of salt, and the potatoes. Boil them until you can easily stab a fork through one, like 15 to 25 minutes depending on the size of your potatoes. If you cook them too long they’ll start falling apart and your salad will be a damn mess. Set a timer if your ass gets easily distracted. You’re already checking Instagram while reading this, aren’t you?
3 When the potatoes are tender, drain them and throw them in a large bowl. Add the celery, carrots, and green onions, then pour the dressing all over that bitch. Add the salt and some pepper and mix that motherfucker up so everything is cooked. Let the salad sit in the fridge for at least 30 minutes so that the potatoes can soak in all the flavor. If it looks dry after that, then add a little more vinegar and olive oil to get it going. Serve right away or make this shit the night before the party. Nobody will fucking know and we won’t snitch.</instructions>
		<modifications>The poppy seeds in this dish make it extra dope, but if you can’t find them or don’t wanna spend the extra cash, just leave them out. It’ll still be legit.</modifications>
