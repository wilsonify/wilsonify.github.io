# QUICK BLENDER MARINARA



#### yields  5 cup


## ingredients
* 5 clove garlic 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* 1 1/2 tsp dried thyme 
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano 
* 1 pinch of red pepper flakes 
* 2 cans (28 ounces each) whole tomatoes 
* 1 pinch salt 



## Instructions
1 In a blender or food processor, throw in the garlic, olive oil, thyme, oregano, pepper flakes, and salt and pulse until that shit is all minced up. Grab the cans of tomatoes and drain off the extra liquid. (But save the liquid you drained off and use it in your next soup or to thin out some pasta sauce. WASTE NOT, WANT NOT, MOTHERFUCKER.) Dump the canned tomatoes right into the blender. Run that fucker until the tomatoes are nice and broken down. Done. Just stick it in the fridge or freeze for later.



## Modifications
Make sure there isnâ€™t a shit-ton of salt or any other seasoning in those tomatoes.
