# SILKY ROASTED BELL PEPPER PASTA WITH ZUCCHINI AND BASIL RIBBONS



#### yields  4 AS A MAIN DISH, BUT IF YOU’RE SOLO THESE


## ingredients
* 12 ounces soft silken tofu 
* 2 roasted red bell peppers 
* 3 to 4 clove garlic 
* 1 1/2 TBL red wine vinegar 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast 
* 3/4 tsp salt 
* 1 tsp red pepper flakes 
* 1 LB spaghetti, linguine, or fettuccine 
* 4 medium zucchini 
* 1 cup basil, sliced into thin strips 



## Instructions
0 chop roasted bell peppers

1 First make the sauce. Throw everything together in a blender or a food processor and run on

high until the sauce is smooth. Pour it into a small saucepan and stick it on the stove. We’ll

come back to this    in a minute.

2 Now cook the pasta according to the package directions . . . or your pasta instincts. While

the pasta is cooking, slice the zucchini into thin matchsticks. Yeah, show off those knife skills.

Try to get the strips as close as you can to the size of the noodles so they can blend in when

you mix those mother ers together. Don’t spend all day trying to make this happen. Just

aim for noodle twins and  deal with wherever you end up.

3 Right before the pasta is done, start up a low heat under the sauce you made earlier so it

warms up, but doesn’t simmer. When the pasta is done, drain it, and then immediately throw

it in a large bowl. Add the zucchini ribbons to the hot pasta and then add the warmed-up

sauce. Mix it all around and the heat from the pasta and sauce should start to soften the

zucchini just a little bit. Fold in the basil and then taste. Add more vinegar, salt, or red pepper

flakes—whatever you feel like. Top with a basil leaf or two and serve right away.



## Modifications
You want the kind in aseptic packaging. It’s on the shelf near the soy sauce.

 Whole wheat or regular pasta will do. Just use long, thin noodles.

 Aim for zucchini 4 to 5 inches long, with the circumference of a baby’s arm.
