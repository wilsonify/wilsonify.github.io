#### yields 6 TO 8 PEOPLE AS A SIDE
## ingredients
* 2 TBL olive oil* 2 TBL olive oil * 2 TBL olive oil
* 1/2 tsp salt

0.5 yellow onion, cut into thin strips
* 2 LB winter squash* 2 LB winter squashice

* 1 green onion green onion
* 1 TBL mint* 1 TBL mint

Black pepper

# instructions
0. finely chop green onion (about 2 TBL); chop mint
0 seed squash and cut into 1-inch-thick wedges or rings, but with the skin on for looks.
1 Crank up your oven to 425Â°F. Grab 2 rimmed baking sheets. Yeah, sorry, this shit takes 2 of them.
2 In a large bowl, mix together the oil, cumin, and salt. Add the onion and squash and stir that shit around, using your hands or a big-ass spoon until everything has a little something on it. Pour that out in a mostly even layer over the 2 baking sheets and stick them in the oven. Roast, flipping the wedges over halfway, until both sides are nice and golden or browned in some spots, about 30 minutes.
3 While that is roasting, make the dressing: Mix everything together in a small glass.
4 When the squash is all done, dump it all out onto a platter, drizzle the dressing over it, and serve hot. Sprinkle with some pepper and more salt if you think it needs that shit.

# modifications

Kabocha, acorn, or delicata squash all are legit as fuck here. You can do one giant squash or two smaller 1-LB guys and mix shit up. As long as you cut them up into the same size, those fuckers will roast at the same rate. And use a sharp knife or you will fucking cut yourself trying to wiggle that shit through. Be careful and have some goddamn sense.
