## Instructions

### 1. Toast the seasonings.
- Mince 4 garlic cloves. In a large nonstick pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
- When the oil begins to shimmer, add the minced garlic, ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika, and ½ teaspoon each of red pepper flakes, Urfa biber (if using), and cumin.
- Season with a big pinch of salt and pepper and stir just until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (do not let the garlic brown or the oil will taste bitter).

### 2. Simmer the beans.
- Add 2 (15-ounce) cans of drained butter beans and 1 cup of vegetable broth.
- Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer until the beans are warm and the broth is just slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, trim and chop 2 green onions. Prepare ⅓ cup each of chopped dill and parsley.

### 3. Finish and serve.
- Juice in two lemons, then stir in 2 chopped green onions and fresh herbs.
- Serve warm.
