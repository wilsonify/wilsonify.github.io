# LENTIL TACOS WITH CARROT-JICAMA SLAW



#### yields  6 TO 8 TACOS


## ingredients
* 3 cup water 
* 1 cup black lentils, rinsed 
* 1/2 tsp olive oil 
* 0.5 onion 
* 8 ounces mushrooms, cut into bite-size pieces 
* 1 TBL soy sauce or tamari 
* 2 or 3 clove garlic 
* 2 TBL apple juice 
* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil 
* CARROT-JICAMA SLAW 
* 0.5 LB jicama 
* 1 small cucumber 
* 1 carrot 
* 2 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1 TBL lime juice 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* Sweet Fresh Herb Salsa 



## Instructions
0 chop onion

1 For the lentils: Bring the water to boil in a medium saucepot over high heat and add the

lentils. Turn the heat to low and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain the excess

water and set aside.

2 In a large wok or skillet, heat the oil over medium heat and add the onion. Cook until the

onion becomes translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release

some of their liquid, about 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce, stir, and then add the lentils. Mix

that    up and then add the garlic and apple juice. Yes,  apple juice. Just do it. Cook

until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the

toasted sesame oil. Taste that   .  awesome.

3 Now, the slaw. Cut the jicama, cucumber, and carrot into matchsticks no more than 1 inch

long. Toss with the rest of the slaw ingredients and refrigerate before you serve it up.

4 To make the tacos, warm the tortillas and fill those gifts from god with the lentil mix, some

shredded cabbage or lettuce, the jicama slaw, and top with that herb salsa. These  ers aren’t

half bad cold either if you are feeling too lazy to heat up leftovers. Cold tacos are still

mother tacos.



## Modifications
These little bastards (also called beluga lentils—because they look like caviar) hold their shape better than other

lentils, so look for them.

 Button, cremini, or shiitake mushrooms are cool. Use whatever.

 The real   , not apple-flavored drink.

 This is a big-ass root that tastes so  good. It’s like the product of a one-night stand between an apple

and a potato. Don’t fight it, just buy it.
