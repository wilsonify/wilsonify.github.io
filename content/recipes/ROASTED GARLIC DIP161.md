# ROASTED GARLIC DIP



#### yields  5 cup


## ingredients
* 12 ounces soft silken tofu 
* 5 clove roasted garlic 
* 2 TBL minced shallot or white onion 
* 1 TBL apple cider vinegar or lemon juice 
* 1 TBL minced chives 
* 1 TBL minced fresh parsley 
* 1/2 tsp salt 



## Instructions
1 Throw the tofu, garlic, and shallot into a blender or food processor and run until it looks all smooth. If you put the papery garlic skin in there too, we swear weâ€™re going drive over there and confiscate your whole fucking kitchen from you. Damn. Throw in the rest of the ingredients and pulse it a couple of times so everything gets chopped up and mixed in but the herbs are still kinda visible.

2 Let it sit in the fridge at least 1 hour before serving so that the flavors can get to know each other. Serve with whatever vegetables you like and get to dipping. It will keep for 3 or 4 days in the fridge.



## Modifications
Scared of tofu?

 Need some help?
