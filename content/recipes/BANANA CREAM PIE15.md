# Simple Banana Cream Pie

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 cup butter
- 2 tablespoons olive or grapeseed oil
- 2-3 tablespoons almond milk
- 1/4 cup cornstarch or arrowroot powder
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk
- 1 cup plain almond or other nondairy milk
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 large ripe bananas
- Whipped Cream

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the crust:**
   - Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and grab a standard pie plate.
   - In a medium bowl, mix flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.
   - Cut butter into the flour until it resembles coarse sand. You can also use a food processor for this step.
   - Stir in olive oil and 2 tablespoons of almond milk until a shaggy dough forms. Add more milk if needed.
   - Press the dough into the pie plate evenly covering the bottom and sides.
   - Bake the crust for 12 minutes with foil and dried beans to weigh it down. Then remove the foil and beans and bake for another 12-15 minutes until golden. Let it cool.

2. **Make the custard filling:**
   - In a medium saucepan, whisk together cornstarch, sugar, and salt.
   - Slowly whisk in around 1/3 cup of coconut milk until smooth, then add the remaining coconut milk, almond milk, and vanilla.
   - Place the pot over medium-high heat and whisk until the mixture starts bubbling and thickens, about 5 minutes.
   - Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently, stirring constantly, for 7 to 10 minutes until the custard thickens enough to hold its shape.

3. **Assemble the pie:**
   - Once the pie crust has cooled, slice bananas into rounds no thicker than 0.5 inch.
   - Line the crust with banana slices.
   - Pour the warm custard over the bananas in the pie shell.
   - Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours until the custard sets.

4. **Serve:**
   - Once the custard has set, spread whipped cream over the top.
   - Serve and enjoy! Best consumed within 3 days.

## Notes
- You can use whole wheat pastry, all-purpose, or a combination of flours for the crust.
- Ensure the oil has a consistency similar to room temperature butter, not too runny.
- Refrigerate the dough briefly if the oil is too warm.
