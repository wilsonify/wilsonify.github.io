# GRILLED EGGPLANT WITH SOBA NOODLES



#### yields  4 PEOPLE OR JUST 1 IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THIS


## ingredients
* 2 TBL toasted seg for the marinade in a glass. Slice the eggplant crosswise into .25-inch

rounds. Place the eggplant in a large pan of some kind and pour the marinade over that shit.

Let the eggplant marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour if you’ve got the fucking

time.

2 While the eggplant marinates, cook the soba noodles according to the package directions.

Drain the noodles and rinse them with cool water so that they aren’t still cooking. Place them

in a large bowl and add the toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar. Stir it all up.

3 Bring your grill or grill pan to a medium heat (around 300° to 350°F). Oil the grill grates.

When the eggplant is done marinating, grill the eggplant slices (but don’t throw away that

marinade) on each side 2 to 3 minutes or until you see some grill marks. If the eggplant begins

to look a little dry, take the slices and dip them in or brush them with the remaining marinade

and continuing cooking them until done. Eggplant hydration. Boom.

4 When all of the eggplant is done cooking and has cooled slightly, cut it up into .5-inch

squares. Mix together .5 cup of the leftover marinade and the 3 TBL of water. Pour

that mess all over the noodles and mix. Toss in the eggplant and basil and mix again. Top with

sesame seeds and serve at room temperature or cold.



## Modifications
You can use whole wheat pasta or whatever here, but soba noodles—made of buckwheat flour—taste way fucking

better.
