# WHITE BEAN AND ROSEMARY HUMMUS


## ingredients
* 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water
* 3 TBL balsamic vinegar 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1 TBL minced fresh rosemary 



## Instructions
1 Add everything to a food processor or blender and let that shit run until itâ€™s nice and

creamy. You know, aim for hummus-like. You could do this by hand with a potato masher but

it will fucking take a while even if you are ripped.

2 Let it sit for 30 minutes in the fridge before serving so all those flavors can get acquainted.



## Modifications
Or two 15-ounce cans
