# BASIC MAPLE GRANOLA WITH ADD-IN IDEAS

**Yields:** 5 cups

## Ingredients
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 1/2 cup sunflower seeds
- 1/2 cup almonds
- 1/4 cup uncooked millet
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries (optional)

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 300Â°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the oats, sunflower seeds, almonds, and millet.
3. In a medium glass, stir together the maple syrup, olive oil, and vanilla. Pour this mixture over the oat mixture and stir until everything is well coated. Add the cinnamon and salt, and stir again.
4. Spread the mixture evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to ensure even cooking. The granola is done when it looks toasted and the oats feel crispy instead of damp.
5. If using dried cranberries, stir them into the granola after baking. Let the granola cool completely on the baking sheet, then store it in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.

## Add-In Ideas
- Try these nut and fruit combos:
  - Almonds with chopped dried apricots or strawberries
  - Walnuts with dried pears or figs
  - Pecans with dried cherries
  - Peanuts with dried apples or bananas
- Use whatever nuts and dried fruits you prefer!

## Modifications
- You can use 1 cup of any nuts of your choice.
- If you don't have millet, simply add more oats.
- Quality maple syrup can be expensive, but it's worth it for delicious granola. Alternatively, use any dried fruit you like.
