# SMOKY BLACK-EYED PEAS WITH ROASTED SWEET POTATOES AND COLLARDS



#### yields  6


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup dried black-eyed peas 
* 6 medium to large sweet potatoes 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 onion 
* 3 ribs celery 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1/2 tsp ground allspice 
* 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg 
* 1/2 tsp paprika 
* 2 to 3 clove garlic 
* 3 to 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce 
* 3 cup vegetable broth 
* 2 or 3 batches Wilted Greens 



## Instructions
0 chop onion, celery, chipole peppers.

1 Rinse the black-eyed peas and throw out any grit or  ed-up looking peas. Put the peas in

a large bowl and cover them with a couple inches of water. Let them soak overnight or for at

least 6 hours. After soaking, drain the peas and start  cooking.

2 Before you start to cook the peas, crank your oven to 400°F. Grab your sweet potatoes and

stab the   out of them with a fork in a couple spots. This helps the steam release while they

roast and helps you get some of that stabbiness out your system. Put them on a baking sheet

and sit them in the oven until you can stick a knife through them without resistance, about 45

minutes.

3 Now back to the black-eyed peas. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the

onion and sauté that    until it starts to brown in some places, about 5 minutes. Add the

celery and cook until it starts to get a little soft, about 2 minutes. Add the salt and spices and

sauté for 30 seconds. Add the garlic and chipotles to the pot and cook for another 30 seconds.

4 Toss the drained black-eyed peas into the pot along with the broth and bring that    to a

simmer. Let it simmer uncovered until the peas are tender. This can take anywhere from 30

minutes to 1 hour depending on how long you soaked your peas and how old they are. If you

start running out of liquid before those are ready, add a little more broth or water. If the peas

are tender and you’ve still got too much broth in there, just drain some of that    off. Not a

big  deal. Just check the seasoning when you are all done and add more herbs or spices if

you think it needs it.

5 Make your wilted collard greens right before the sweet potatoes are done roasting.

6 When the sweet potatoes are done, split them open lengthwise and fluff them with a fork.

Feel free to add a little butter and a pinch of salt to spice those sweet  ers up.

Pour at least 1 cup of peas over the potatoes and 2 cup of the greens. Serve right away.



## Modifications
This is not a blend of spices—it’s a berry with a confusing ass name. It is in a lot of Caribbean food and

should be right next to all the spices and    in your store.

 These smoked peppers in sauce are sold in a tiny can and are usually near the salsa and beans. When you chop

the chipotles, cut them open and scrape out the seeds. If you prefer it hot, then keep some of the seeds in, but think of

your butt hole tomorrow as you make that call.
