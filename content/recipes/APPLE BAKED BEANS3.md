# Apple Baked Beans

#### Yields 6 as a Side

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cup dried white beans
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 0.5 yellow onion
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 can (15 ounces) low- or no-salt tomato sauce
- 1 TBL molasses
- 2 tsp soy sauce or tamari
- 1 rosemary sprig
- 2 1/2 cup vegetable broth

## Instructions

1. Chop onion and apple.

2. Sift through the beans and pick out any that look damaged. Soak them in a large bowl with water overnight.

3. Drain the softened beans.

4. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saut√© onion until it begins to brown (about 5 minutes). Add garlic and smoked paprika, cook for another 30 seconds.

5. Add drained beans, tomato sauce, molasses, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, and rosemary. Stir and bring to a simmer, then add the broth.

6. Simmer until beans are almost tender, approximately 1 hour. Add apple and simmer until apple is tender and beans are soft, about 30 minutes more.

7. Remove the rosemary sprig before serving.

## Modifications

Use the whole rosemary branch; 

the leaves will fall off during cooking. 

Remove the stick when the beans are done.
