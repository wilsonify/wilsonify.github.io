# WATERMELON-STRAWBERRY TEQUILA PUNCH
#### yields
18 cups
## ingredients
* 1 big seedless watermelon (about 16 LBs) big seedless watermelon (about 16 LBs)
* 4 cup strawberries (about 1 LB)* 4 cup strawberries (about 1 LB)r* 4 cup strawberries (about 1 LB)* 4 cup strawberries (about 1 LB)
* 1 1/2 cup tequila
			<ingredient optional="yes">
* 1 TBL of your favorite liquid sweetener like agave syrup


# instructions
1 Halve the watermelon lengthwise and scoop out all the flesh into a big container with high sides. You want to use this container again to mix everything up, so choose wisely or you’ll have more dishes. Working in batches, unless is you have the biggest fucking blender of all time, puree all the watermelon up.
2 As you go, strain the watermelon juice through a fine-mesh sieve or some cheesecloth to get rid of all that grainy shit. Strain it into the big container from before. You should get about 12 cup juice.
3 Take 2 cup of that juice and throw it in the blender with the strawberries and lime juice. Puree that fucker until smooth. You can strain this shit too if you want, but we kinda like the strawberry bits in the punch so we just pour it right in the watermelon juice container. You do you.
4 Stick this in the fridge and only stir in the sparkling water and tequila right before you serve. If it isn’t sweet enough because you got some garbage fruit, then stir in the agave. Serve cold with plenty of ice or frozen fruit to keep it cold.
