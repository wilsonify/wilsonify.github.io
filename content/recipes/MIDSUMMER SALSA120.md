1 If you’re a picky motherfucker about salsa, you’ve got a couple options here. Mix everything
together in a bowl and leave it chunky, or throw everything in a food processor and run that
shit until you get the consistency your ass prefers. Maybe you like your salsa chunky, maybe
not. If salsa is being served, who really gives a fuck about consistency? Chill at least 20 minutes
before serving.
