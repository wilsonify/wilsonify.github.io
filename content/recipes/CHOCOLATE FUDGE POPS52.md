		<instructions>1 Warm up the milk on the stovetop or in the microwave so that it is warm but not super
fucking hot. Next you need to melt the chocolate. You can melt it either by slowly heating it in
the microwave in 25-second increments and stirring until it is melted—OR you build a double
boiler like a fucking boss. Grab a medium saucepan and fill it with 1 or 2 inches of water.
Throw an all-metal bowl on top of that and make sure the whole mouth of the pan is covered
and that the water inside isn’t touching the bottom of the bowl. Put this over medium-low
heat and pour the chocolate chips into the bowl. The steam will heat the bowl and melt the
chips; just keep stirring the chocolate and fucking trust the method. When the chocolate looks
all smooth, turn off the heat. This whole process should take about 3 minutes.
2 Once the chocolate is melted, add it, the milk, and the tofu to a blender and mix that shit
up. Make sure everything is well combined and there are no secret chocolate chunks hiding out.
Pour this into your molds and stick them in the freezer for about 40 minutes. At that point,
take out your pop molds and then push the sticks in. Freezing these motherfuckers a little bit
first helps make sure you won’t push the stick so far in that you end up with some sad-ass
kabob. Freeze until hard. They will keep for at least a month in the freezer.</instructions>
		<modifications>You want the shit in the aseptic packaging. The kind of package you find on the shelf near the soy sauce, not tofu
packed in water in the fridge.</modifications>
