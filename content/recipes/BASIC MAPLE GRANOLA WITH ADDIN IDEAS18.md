# BASIC MAPLE GRANOLA WITH ADD-IN IDEAS



#### yields  5 cup


## ingredients
* 3 cup rolled oats 
* 1/2 cup sunflower seeds 
* 1/2 cup almonds 
* 1/4 cup uncooked millet 
* 1/2 cup maple syrup 
* 1/3 cup olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/2 cup dried cranberries (optional)



## Instructions
1 Heat your oven to 300°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with some parchment paper.

2 Mix together the oats, seeds, nuts, and millet in a large bowl.

3 In a medium glass, stir together the maple syrup, oil, and vanilla. Pour this all over the oat

mixture and stir that    around until everything looks coated. Add the cinnamon and the salt

and stir.

4 Pour all of this evenly over that baking sheet and stick it in the oven for 40 minutes. Stir it

every 10 minutes so that it cooks evenly. You’ll know this    is done when everything looks

kinda toasted and the oats feel crispy instead of damp. Stir in the dried fruit now if you’re using

any. Let that all cool on the baking sheet and then store it in an airtight container for up to 2

weeks.

5 Want to mix it up? Try these nut and fruit combos: almonds and chopped, dried apricots or

strawberries; walnuts and dried pears or figs; pecans and dried cherries; peanuts and dried

apples or bananas. Just use whateverthe  sounds good to you.



## Modifications
Basically, 1 cup of whatever nuts you prefer.

No millet?   it, just add more oats.

Legit syrup can get kinda  expensive. But so can granola. Save up for the good   .

Or use any dried fruit you like.
