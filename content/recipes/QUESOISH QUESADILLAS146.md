# QUESO-ISH QUESADILLAS



#### yields  6 QUESADILLAS


## ingredients
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 red bell pepper 
* 1/2 cup corn kernels 
* 1 1/2 cup cooked pinto beans 
* 1/4 tsp ground cumin 
* 1 pinch salt 
* 1 cup Butternut Squash Queso-ish Dip 
* 2 cup shredded cabbage, red or green 
* 6 burrito-size tortillas, whatever kind you like 



## Instructions
0 chop bell pepper

1 In a medium skillet or sauté pan, warm up the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bell pepper and corn and sauté for 2 minutes so that bell pepper starts getting a little soft. Add the pinto beans and do your best to smash a good amount of those fibrous mother ers up so that you get a little paste going in some spots. Throw in the cumin and salt and sauté for another 30 seconds. It should smell dope as hell. Pour in ¾ cup of the butternut queso and stir until everything is all mixed up and warm, 1 to 2 minutes depending on if you had your queso in the fridge or whatever. Fold in the cabbage and turn off the heat.

2 To make a quesadilla, grab your griddle or large flat-bottomed pan and warm the  er up over medium heat. Throw on a tortilla and warm up both sides for about 15 seconds. Still on the griddle, spread 3 or 4 spoonfuls of the filling over half the tortilla so that it’s no more than a .5 inch thick. Spread on a little of the remaining queso and fold the tortilla over so you are left with a delicious-as-hell half-moon. Flip it over on the griddle for another 20 seconds so both sides are nice and crispy and then take it off. Repeat all this until you are out of filling, queso, and tortillas.

3 Cut the quesadillas into little pizza-shaped wedges and serve warm. Make sure you save yourself one, because these  ers will go fast.



## Modifications
Frozen corn is okay to use. It’s not the star of the  show in this recipe.

 One 15-ounce can of beans is totally fine, but drain and rinse those  ers.

 You don’t know how badly we just wanted to write “Now throw that  er in a quesadilla, just figure it out.” Explaining how to construct a quesadilla feels like explaining how to breathe.
