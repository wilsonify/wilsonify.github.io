# LANDLOCKED CEVICHE



#### yields  4 TO 6 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 1 small head of cauliflower 
* 2 cup diced tomatoes (about 4 medium) 
* 1/2 cup red onion 
* 1 jalapeño 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1/2 cup lime juice 
* 1/4 cup cilantro 
* 1 avocado 
* Black pepper, to taste 



## Instructions
0 chop cauliflower into tiny-ass bites (about 2.5 cup). Dice jalapeno and avacodo

1 In a medium bowl, mix together the cauliflower, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeño, salt, and lime juice. Add the cilantro and let that sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour so that the lime juice has some time to soften everything up. That’s its job, so let that fucker work.

2 Add the avocado and serve right away, with Black pepper.

Keep your salsa, dips, and salads from being a watered-down mess by removing the guts from your tomatoes as you chop. Those seeds and the gel (total technical term) that holds them in place add zero fucking flavor and are only holding your snack game back.

Want to make this shit the night before? Just leave out the cilantro and avocado until right before you serve it so they don’t get all gnarly looking while soaking overnight.
