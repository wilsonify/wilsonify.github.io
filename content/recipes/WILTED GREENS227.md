* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari

# instructions
1 Remove the tough stems and slice the greens into strips about 1 inch wide and 2 inches
long. You should aim for around 6 cup. This might seem like way too many greens, but they’ll
cook down to fucking nothing. Trust.
2 Grab a big wok or skillet and heat up the oil over medium heat. Add the greens and toss
them around until everything has a little oil on it and cook for about 30 seconds.
3 Add the water, garlic, lemon juice, and soy sauce and then keep tossing those greens around
so that it all cooks down. This shouldn’t take more than a minute and a half. Once all the
greens are wilted, turn off the heat and serve.
