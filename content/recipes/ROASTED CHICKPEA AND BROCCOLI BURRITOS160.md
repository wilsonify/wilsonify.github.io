# ROASTED CHICKPEA AND BROCCOLI BURRITOS



#### yields  4 TO 6 BURRITOS


## ingredients
* 1 large yellow onion 
* 1 red bell pepper 
* 1 large crown of broccoli 
* 3 cup cooked chickpeas 
* 3 TBL olive oil 
* 1-2 TBL soy sauce 
* 2 tsp chili powder 
* 1 tsp ground cumin 
* 1 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1/2 tsp ground coriander 
* Cayenne pepper, to taste 
* 4 clove garlic 
* 0.5 lime 
* 4-6 flour tortillas 
* Burrito trimmings such as spinach, avocado, cilantro, and Fire-Roasted Salsa 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 425°F. Grab a large rimmed baking sheet.

2 Chop up the onion, bell pepper, and broccoli ’til they’re the size of a chickpea. Place all the

chopped up veggies in a large bowl with the cooked chickpeas. Pour in the oil and soy sauce,

stir, and then throw all the spices in there. Mix until all the vegetables and shit are covered.

Put all of that on the baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.

3 Take it out of the oven—don’t fucking burn yourself—then add the garlic and stir it

around. Bake for another 15 minutes. The broccoli might look a little burnt at this point but

that is the plan, so chill the fuck out and take it out of the oven. Squeeze the lime juice over the

pan and stir the roasted chickpeas and veggies all around. Taste and see if it needs more spices

or anything.

4 Now make a motherfucking burrito. We like ours with spinach, avocado, cilantro, and some

fire-roasted salsa, but do your thing.



## Modifications
Or two 15-ounce cans

 Or more cumin if you don’t want to go to the store.
