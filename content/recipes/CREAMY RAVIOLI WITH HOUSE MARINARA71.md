# CREAMY RAVIOLI WITH HOUSE MARINARA

## ingredients
* 2 cup all-purpose flour
* ½ cup flour
* 1 pinch salt
* ¾ to 1 cup water
* 3 TBL olive oil
* House Marinara
* Tofu Ricotta


# instructions

1 To make the dough: In a large bowl, combine the flours and salt and stir it all around. 

Make a crater in the center of that and add ¾ cup of the water and the olive oil. 

Mix the liquids and flour together until a shaggy dough comes together. 

If there’s still a bunch of dry-ass flour in the bowl, add the remaining .25 cup water—but no more—1 TBL at a time until it comes together (it should be a little drier and less sticky than pizza dough). 

Once you’ve got your ball of dough, knead it on a well-floured surface for 10 minutes. 

Place the dough back in the bowl, cover, and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes but up to 2
hours.

2 While the dough is resting, prepare the tofu ricotta and marinara.

3 To form the ravioli, you’ll need a ravioli stamp. 

First, cut the dough in half. On a well-floured surface, roll out one piece to a rough rectangle that’s twice the width of your ravioli stamp and about .125 inch thick. 

With a short end of the rectangle facing you, use the stamp to imprint the dough with 2 side-by-side ravioli squares, fitting about 15 of these pairs down the length of the rectangle. 

Fill each ravioli imprint on the left-hand side with 1 TBL of the tofu ricotta. 

Using a pastry brush or paper towel, wet the dough along the edges of all the  stamps and fold the right-hand row over the left so that all the stamps line up and the filling is completely covered (see this page for a pic). 

Stamp over each ravioli again until they are sealed, then transfer to a large baking sheet. 

Repeat this process with the other piece of dough.

4 To cook, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add the ravioli in batches of 8 to 10,
depending on the size of your pot. Boil gently until the raviolis float, 2 to 4 minutes.

5 Serve with the marinara.

# modifications

just buy wonton wrappers and use them instead. 

Skip the whole ravioli stamp and rolling out thing. 

Just place a little filling in the center of a wonton wrapper, wet the edges, and press another wrapper over the top, making sure to seal the edges.
