# Southern Baked Beans

**Yield:** 8 cups, 8 Servings  
**Time:** 12 hours soaking, 1 hour cooking, 10 mins active

## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried navy beans or other white beans, soaked overnight and drained
- 4 cups water
- 1 medium yellow or white onion (8 ounces), chopped
- 1/4 cup liquid aminos, such as Bragg’s, plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste, preferably double concentrated
- 1 teaspoon Spanish smoked paprika (pimenton)
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- Fine salt

## Instructions

1. In a 6-quart Instant Pot or other multicooker, combine the beans with the water, onion, liquid aminos, tomato paste, smoked paprika, black pepper, and mustard.
2. Secure the lid on the pot 
3. close the pressure valve. 
4. Select PRESSURE (HIGH) 
5. set to 30 minutes. It takes about 10 minutes for the appliance to come to pressure before cooking begins. 
6. Once cooking is complete, cover your hand with a towel or hot pad 
7. manually release the pressure by moving the pressure-release handle to “Venting.”  Be cautious of steam.
8. Taste the broth and season with more liquid aminos and/or salt, if needed. 
9. Serve hot.

## Substitutions

- Use cannellini, Great Northern, cranberry/borlotti, or pinto beans.
- Liquid aminos substitutes: Coconut aminos, low-sodium tamari, or soy sauce.

## Variations

To bake these instead:
- Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 250 degrees.
- Bring the beans and water to a boil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat, then lower the heat and simmer the beans gently for 15 minutes.
- Stir in the remaining ingredients except for the salt, cover, and bake for about 3 hours, or until the beans are very tender and fragrant.
- Check inside the pot occasionally; if the liquid reduces and no longer covers the beans, add boiling water to barely cover and continue cooking.
- Taste and season with more liquid aminos and/or salt if needed.
