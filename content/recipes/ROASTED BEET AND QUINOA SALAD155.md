# ROASTED BEET AND QUINOA SALAD



#### yields  4 AS A SIDE DRESSING


## ingredients
* 1 shallot 
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard 
* 3 TBL vinegar 
* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 3 medium beets 
* 1 tsp vinegar 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* Salt 
* pepper 
* 2 cup water 
* 1 cup quinoa, rinsed 
* 1 cup kale 
* 1/4 cup diced fresh herbs 



## Instructions
0 dice shallot; peel and chop beets into small chunks (about 1.5 cup); de-stem kale and slice into strips

1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Grab a rimmed baking sheet and have it on standby.

2 Make the dressing: Pour all the ingredients together in a jar and shake that    up.

3 For the salad: In a medium bowl, toss the beets together with the vinegar, olive oil, and a

pinch of salt. Your hands might get kinda red and bloody looking from the beets. Don’t worry

about that   ; it will wash off, so quit complaining. Pour the mixture onto the baking sheet

and roast for 20 minutes, stirring the beets halfway through.

4 While the beets roast up, bring the water to a boil in a medium pot. Add the quinoa. Once

that    starts boiling again, cover, and adjust the heat to low. Cook the quinoa at a slow

simmer until it is tender, about 15 minutes. Just taste it and you’ll figure that    out. Drain

any extra water that remains in the pot and scoop the quinoa into a medium bowl. Fold the

kale into the hot quinoa and then add the dressing. Add the fresh herb of your choice and mix

well.

5 When the beets are done, fold those ruby red   right in to the quinoa. Add salt and

pepper to taste. Serve this salad at room temperature or refrigerate until cold.



## Modifications
Dill, basil, and parsley all work well here. Use whichever of those you’ve got hanging out in the fridge.
