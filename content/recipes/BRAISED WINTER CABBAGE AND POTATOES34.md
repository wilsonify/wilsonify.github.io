# BRAISED WINTER CABBAGE AND POTATOES



#### yields  4 TO 6 AS A SIDE


## ingredients
* 1 small head of green cabbage (about 1 LB) 
* 0.5 yellow onion 
* 3 carrots 
* 1 cup vegetable broth 
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 0.5 LB small white or golden potatoes 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 1 TBL fresh rosemary 
* Salt 
* pepper 
* 1 TBL lemon juice 



## Instructions
1 Heat your oven to 350°F.

2 Chop the cabbage in half and slice into wedges no thicker than 2 inches. If it has an extra

thick core, chop that fucker right out. Roughly chop the onion and carrots. Big chunks are

fine because they are going to have time to cook all the way through.

3 Grab a 9 x 13-inch baking dish and lay the cabbage pieces all down in one layer. Throw the

chopped onion and carrots all around them and then pour in the broth and oil. Cover with foil

and stick in the oven for 40 minutes.

4 While that cabbage business is braising, slice the small potatoes in half. You want chunks

about the size of the head of a soup spoon. When 40 minutes have gone by, take the cabbage

out of the oven and turn the wedges over. Next, add the potatoes all over those motherfuckers

and sprinkle in the garlic, rosemary, and .25 tsp salt. Stir the potatoes around so that they

kinda get some of the remaining broth on them, but don’t spend a lot of time on this. It’s not

worth a bunch of trouble. Cover that fucker back up and let it bake for 40 more minutes, then

take off the foil, and let it go for 10 more minutes.

5 When all that time has passed, take that heavy-ass dish out of the oven, drizzle the lemon

juice over it, and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm. Some vinegary hot sauce on those

potatoes wouldn’t be the worst idea.
