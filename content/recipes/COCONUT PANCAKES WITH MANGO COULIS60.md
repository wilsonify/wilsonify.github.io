<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 To make the coulis: Throw everything in a food processor or blender and let that fucker run until it’s nice and smooth. Pour it into a container and stick it in the fridge until the pancakes are ready. This will keep for a couple days so make this shit ahead of time and get it out of the way.<br>2 Make the pancakes: In a medium glass, mix together the milk, lemon juice, and ground flax and then set that shit aside.<br>3 In a big bowl, whisk together the flour, coconut, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Make a crater in the middle of the dry mix and pour in the milk. Mix that all together until there are no more dry spots but don’t go crazy. Mixing it too much will make your pancakes tough, so try and just chill. No need to start your day off with a pancake panic attack.<br>4 Now, you probably know what to do when it comes to cooking up some pancakes, but in case this is your first time doing this shit yourself, keep reading. Grab a skillet or griddle and warm it over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with some spray oil and pour some pancake batter onto the griddle for each pancake you want. Cook the first side until bubbles appear on top, 2 to 3 minutes. The bubbles mean your pancake has cooked through. Flip and cook the other side until it turns golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.<br>5 Serve warm, spread with a little butter and with mango coulis all over and some fresh fruit on the side. Sprinkle on some extra toasted coconut if you want people to know exactly how you like to get your day started.<br>6 top with fresh-cut fruit, like bananas, strawberries, or extra mangos; a smear of butter</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Can’t find a ripe mango? Don’t fucking stress. Thawed frozen mango (2 cup) works good too.<br> If your mango is superripe and delicious, you might not need any sugar, as the amount to use is directly correlated to the shittiness of your mango. Taste and you’ll fucking know what to do.<br> Grab the unsweetened coconut, not that supergross sugary shit. To toast it, just throw it in a small skillet over medium-low heat and stir it around until it starts to look sorta golden and smell nice and nutty. Fucking done. Can’t find any shredded coconut? Just leave that shit out and add .5 cup of flour instead.</p></div></div>
