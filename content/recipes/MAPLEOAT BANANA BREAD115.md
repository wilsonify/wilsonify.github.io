# MAPLE-OAT BANANA BREAD
## ingredients
* 2 cup oat flour* 2 cup oat flour

* tsp baking soda

* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamonc* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamons* 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 3 TBL olive oil

* 1 tsp vanilla extract* 1 tsp vanilla extract


# instructions
1 Heat your oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a standard loaf pan so your bread won’t stick.
This shit is critical, so DO NOT skip this step.
2 Grab a medium bowl and mix together the flours, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Set that
aside.
3 In a small glass, mix together the milk and vinegar. Then grab a large bowl and mix together
the mashed banana, maple syrup, olive oil, and vanilla. Once all that is mixed up, add the milk
mixture and blend that motherfucker all over again. Add the dry ingredients to the wet stuff
and mix until there are no more dry spots in the batter.
4 Pour the batter into your loaf pan that you ALREADY GOT READY (RIGHT?) and
sprinkle the sugar over the top. This is just for looks because this bread is vain as fuck. Bake it
until the top is golden and a toothpick comes out clean when you stab it through your bread,
30 to 40 minutes. When the bread it done, take it out of the loaf pan and let it cool a bit
before diving in.

# modifications

This might sound fancy, but just buy cheap rolled oats, throw them in a blender or food processor, and run it
until that shit looks like flour. Done.
 Don’t leave any big chunks or you will have weird uncooked, soggy pockets in your bread. You’ll need about 4 bananas to get here.
