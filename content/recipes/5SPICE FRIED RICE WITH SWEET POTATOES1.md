# instructions

0 chop onion, carrot, and greens no bigger than a quarter

1 Peel the sweet potato and chop into dice-size cubes.

2 In a large wok or skillet, heat 1 tsp of the oil over medium heat. 
   Add the sweet potato and the water and stir-fry the potato, stirring often. 
   If the potato starts to stick, add a little more of the water as needed. 
   Cook until the potato is close to tender and browning on some sides, 5 to 8 minutes. 
   Add the onion and carrot and cook until the onions are translucent, about 3 more minutes. 
   Add the 5-spice powder and garlic, mix well, then remove the vegetables from the pan. 
   Scrape the pan clean cause we aren’t done.

3 In a small glass, mix together the soy sauce, vinegar, and chili paste. 
   Heat the wok back up over medium heat and add the remaining 1 tsp oil. 
   Throw in the rice and stir-fry until it begins to warm, 3 to 5 minutes. 
   Drizzle the sauce over the rice, mix well, then add the cooked vegetables. 
   Stir-fry for a minute so everything is well mixed. 
   Fold in the greens, green onions, and peas. 
   Turn off the heat and serve immediately.
