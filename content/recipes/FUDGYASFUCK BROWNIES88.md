# FUDGY-AS-FUCK BROWNIES
#### yields 16 BROWNIES, IF YOU CUT SHIT UP IN A REASONABLE SIZE
## ingredients
* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seedsc* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds* 2 TBL ground flax seeds soda

* 1/2 tsp salt* 1/2 tsp salt* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 TBL vanilla extract


# instructions
1 Heat your oven up to 350°F. Line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper with some popping over the edges so you can lift the brownies out later.
2 In a small glass, mix together the milk, ground flax seeds, and vinegar with a fork real well so there aren’t any clumps. Set all that shit aside.
3 In a double boiler, homemade fake-out, or microwave, melt the chocolate chips and the oils together until they are all mixed up. Already confused?
4 While that’s all melting, grab a medium bowl and whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
5 When the chocolate and oil mixture is ready, remove it from the heat and stir in the sugar and vanilla really well. Now add the milk-flax mixture, a little at a time, until it’s really fucking in there.
6 Now pour in the flour mixture and stir that shit up until it’s just kinda mixed in and there aren’t a ton of white parts. It’s gonna be thick, but just trust us. The more you mix that shit up, the more likely it is your brownies are gonna get all sunk in the middle, so don’t fuck this up.
7 Pour the mixture in the pan and kinda smear it around so it’s all even. Bake until a toothpick stuck in the middle comes out mostly clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Take it out of the pan after 10 minutes and let it cool completely on a wire rack. If you dig in before it cools, then all that shit will just crumble on you. Be strong and just fucking wait 20 minutes.
8 Cut it up into whatever sizes you want and have at it. Store in the fridge.

# modifications

You might see some shit at the store labeled “Dutch processed cocoa.” Don’t grab that one, it’s different.
