# ROASTED BEET HUMMUS



#### yields  3 cup, ENOUGH FOR 4 TO 6 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 LB beets 
* 1 1/2 cup chickpeas 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 2 TBL tahini 
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 2 TBL lemon juice 
* 2 TBL orange juice 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* WALNUT-HERB CRUMBLE 
* 1/4 cup walnuts, toasted 
* 3 TBL minced fresh dill 
* 3 TBL minced green onions 
* 1 pinch salt 



## Instructions
0. peel, roast, and chop beets

1 In a food processor or blender, combine the beets, chickpeas, garlic, tahini, olive oil, citrus juices, and salt. Run that shit until everything looks smooth. If it’s getting caught up, add a TBL of water to help it out. Done.

2 To make the crumble: Just chop up the walnuts all teeny tiny and mix them in a small bowl with the dill, green onions, and salt.

3 Sprinkle the walnut-herb mixture over the dip and serve. The dip is awesome cold or at room temperature and can totally be made a day ahead. Save the crumble for the day of, though, so those herbs stay looking all green and shit.



## Modifications
No clue how to roast a beet? We’ve got you.

 A 15-ounce can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed, is a legit choice here.

 Tahini is like peanut butter but made out of sesame seeds and equally delicious. It will be near either the peanut butter or the falafel mix at the store.

 Need help getting toasted?
