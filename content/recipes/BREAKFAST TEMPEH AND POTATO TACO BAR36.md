# BREAKFAST TEMPEH AND POTATO TACO BAR



## ingredients
* small yellow or red potatoes 
* 8 ounces tempeh 
* 1 large red bell pepper 
* 0.5 yellow onion 
* 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 TBL lime juice 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1 TBL chili powder 
* 1 tsp paprika 
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 8 to 10 tortillas 
* Toppings: salsa, hot sauce, shredded lettuce, avocado slices or guacamole, cilantro, lime wedges, jalapeño slices 



## Instructions
1 Warm up your oven to 400°F. Grab a 9 by 13-inch baking pan, like what you might use for lasagna, and set it aside.

2 Chop up the potatoes (yes, leave the  skin on) about the size of your thumbnail. Do the same damn thing with the tempeh, bell pepper, and onion.

3 In a large bowl, mix together the broth, oil, lime juice, garlic, spices, and salt. Add the chopped veggies and tempeh to the bowl and stir it all up until everything is coated with flavor. Throw it all into the baking pan, yes including the liquid, cover it with foil, and bake for 20 minutes.

4 Once it’s been braising for about 20 minutes, take off the foil, stir, and bake until the potatoes are soft and the tempeh looks kinda golden, about 25 minutes longer.

5 Serve it up with some warm tortillas and whateverthehell toppings you like in tacos.
