# WHIPPED CREAM

#### yields  5 cups

## ingredients
* 1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk, well chilled
* 2 TBL powdered sugar
* ½ tsp vanilla extract (Optional)

## instructions
1 You need some electric beaters or a stand mixer to do this   . 
Stick the bowl and the beaters in the freezer for 15 minutes to let those bastards get chilly.

2 Take them out after 15 minutes and grab the coconut milk from the fridge without shaking
it up. 
Open up the can and scoop out all the thick white cream on the surface and put it in the
chilled bowl. 
Leave that clearish liquid in the can and use it for a smoothie or something later.
You don’t need that    now. 
Sift in the powdered sugar so that there aren’t any chunks and add the vanilla.

3 Now beat the   out of it on medium-high speed until it starts looking all fluffy and
whipped, 1 to 2 minutes. 
Serve right away. 
It tastes good for a couple days, but it loses some of its airiness the longer it sits.

## Modifications
Put that    in the fridge the day before so you know it’s cold enough. This is not a 30-minute chill kinda

situation. You want to give everything time to get cold and for the fat to separate from the coconut water in there.

  it—just store a bunch of cans in the fridge so you’re always ready.
