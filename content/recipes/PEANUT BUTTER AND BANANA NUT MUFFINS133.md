# PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA NUT MUFFINS



#### yields  12 STANDARD MUFFINS


## ingredients
* 2 cup whole wheat pastry or all-purpose flour 
* 1 TBL baking powder 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 
* 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 
* 3/4 cup plain almond or other nondairy milk 
* 1 1/2 cup mashed ripe banana 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 1/2 cup walnuts or peanuts 



## Instructions
1 Heat your oven to 375°F. Grab your muffin tin and grease that bastard or use paper muffin

liners.

2 In a big bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set the fucker aside.

3 Now in a smaller bowl, mix together the peanut butter and brown sugar until it looks kinda

creamy. Stir in the milk, banana, and vanilla until everything is mixed up.

4 Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until just combined. If you mix it up too

much, your muffins will be tough. Don’t waste all that peanut butter on some fucked-up

muffins. Fold in the nuts now if you are using them.

5 Scoop the batter into the muffin cup. This yields a lot of batter, so fill those fuckers to the

brim so you get nice, domed, bakery-style muffins. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean

when poked in the center of a muffin, 18 to 22 minutes. Take them out of the tin and let cool

for at least 15 minutes before eating.



## Modifications
This usually takes about 3 regular-size bananas.

 You could sub .5 cup chocolate chips in here if you want to drop any illusions that these fuckers aren’t dessert.
