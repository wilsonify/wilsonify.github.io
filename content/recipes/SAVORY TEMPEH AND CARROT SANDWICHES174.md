# SAVORY TEMPEH AND CARROT SANDWICHES



#### yields  4 REGULAR-SIZE SANDWICHES


## ingredients
* 8 ounces tempeh 
* 2 medium carrots 
* 1 cup vegetable broth or water 
* 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari 
* 2 TBL lemon juice 
* 1 1/2 TBL liquid smoke 
* 2 tsp maple syrup or other syrupy sweetener 
* 4 clove garlic, cut into thick slices 
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* Lettuce, sliced tomato, avocado, red onion, and mustard 
* 4 rolls or 8 slices of bread, toasted 



## Instructions
1 Slice the tempeh into planks about .25 inch thick and 2 inches long. Do the same thing with

the carrots so that they are a similar size and shape. No need to fucking measure it out, just

eyeball it.

2 Next, make the marinade: Stir everything together in a saucepan over medium-low heat and

bring it to a simmer. Add the tempeh and carrots and gently stir them around. They won’t all

be covered, just fucking make it work the best you can. After everything simmers together for

about 30 seconds, turn off the heat and pour it all into a shallow dish like a pie pan or some

shit. Cover that up and stick it in the fridge to marinate for at least 4 hours and up to 8. Yeah,

plan ahead, you lazy fuck. We told you to read the goddamn recipe first.

3 When you’re ready to assemble your sandwiches, fry up your tempeh and carrots: In a large

skillet or wok, heat up the oil over medium heat. Lay the tempeh and carrot planks down in

one layer and cook them until the tempeh starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. The

carrots can cook a little faster so keep an eye on that shit. When it starts to look a little dry in

there, or the tempeh feels like it might be sticking, just add a couple spoonfuls of the marinade.

4 Once the tempeh is browned on both sides, then you are ready to make a badass sandwich.

Pile lettuce, tomato, avocado, and red onions onto your favorite toasted bread with a little

mustard. Add a layer of carrot planks and then the tempeh, close that motherfucker up, and go

to town. If you need more help with how to assemble a sandwich, check around on the

Internet, then go cry yourself to sleep.
