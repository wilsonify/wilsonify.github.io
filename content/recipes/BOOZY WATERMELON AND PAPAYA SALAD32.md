1 First make the dressing: In a small glass, mix together the lime juice, tequila, vinegar, oil, and agave.
2 Now the salad: In a large bowl, gently mix together the watermelon, papaya, red onion, and jalapeño (if using). You can’t be rough with this    or it will fall apart.
3 Pour the dressing over the whole bowl and fold in the cilantro and salt as you stir that all up. Serve that    right away.

# modifications

Papaya, like cilantro, is a love it or hate it kinda deal. If you hate it or can’t find it where you’re at, just replace it with more watermelon.
 Optional, but if you’ve come this far, just  go for it.
If you want to make part of this    ahead of time, just wait until right before you serve the salad to dress it and add the cilantro and salt. The dressing and the salt break down the fruit so it won’t look legit if you have it sitting around all made for 6 hours.
