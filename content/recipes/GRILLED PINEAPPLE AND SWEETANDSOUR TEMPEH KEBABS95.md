# instructions
1 First, make the sweet-and-sour sauce: Mix the water and cornstarch together in a small bowl and set that shit aside. We are going to use the cornstarch later to make the sauce all thick and glossy and if you just add that fucker straight in without mixing it up in some liquid you just get a chunky disaster. Like shoes in the ’90s.
2 In a medium saucepot, combine the pineapple juice, vinegar, lime juice, brown sugar, tomato paste, soy sauce or tamari, Sriracha, and garlic. Bring it to a simmer and cook for about 3 minutes, then whisk in the cornstarch mixture and simmer for another minute or two until it thickens up, then turn off the heat. You’ll be amazed by how fucking easy it is and feel real dumb for ever buying a jar of sweet-and-sour. Real fucking dumb. Let this sit covered on the stovetop while you get everything else ready.
3 For the kebabs: Place a steamer insert and a couple inches of water in a small pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the tempeh, cover, and steam until it starts to smell kinda nutty, about 10 minutes.
4 While the tempeh is steaming, mix the broth, vinegar, soy sauce or tamari, and oil together in a medium bowl.
5 When the tempeh is done, dump it into the bowl with the broth mixture and mix it together so every piece gets some of that flavor on it. Let it sit, stirring occasionally, while you chop the veggies.
6 Cut the onion and bell pepper into large chunks about the size of the tempeh cubes. Stick them, the pineapple, and the tempeh on the skewers alternating ingredients until you fill them all up. Like you are making a kebab, since that’s what you are fucking doing.
7 Bring your grill to a medium-high heat.
8 Using a pastry brush or spoon, spread a little bit of the sweet-and-sour sauce over the kebabs. Yeah, it’s gonna be a little messy, but fucking get over it. Spray them lightly with a little oil and head out to the grill. Place the kebabs on the grill and cook for 7 to 9 minutes, turning every couple minutes. You are looking for those bomb-ass grill marks and for the veggies to get golden brown around the edges. If they start looking a little dry before they are done, brush them with a little bit of sweet-and-sour sauce. Take them off the grill, brush with a little more sauce, and let them cool for a bit.
9 Serve warm and watch everyone start asking when the fuck you ran out for takeout. Accept tips.
