# GRILLED PEACH SALSA



#### yields  4 TO 6, ABOUT 3.5 cup


## ingredients
* 3 LB peaches 
* 1/2 tsp oil 
* 1 to 2 serrano peppers, minced 
* 1/2 medium red onion 
* 1 medium tomato 
* 1/4 cup lime juice 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* Handful of cilantro 



## Instructions
0 chop onion (about 2⁄3 cup) and tomato

1 Cut the peaches into wedges no thicker than an inch. You can leave the skin on because

everybody needs more fiber in their motherfucking diet. You should get around 12 wedges out

of each peach. Throw the cut-up peaches in a large bowl with the oil and mix them all together.

2 Bring your grill to a medium-high heat. Place the peaches on there for 45 seconds or so on

each side. You don’t need to cook them; you just want some char marks on there because that

looks pro as fuck. Grilling the peaches also caramelizes their natural sugars, making them

sweeter.

3 When the all peaches are grilled, let them cool for a couple minutes while you chop

everything else up. When the peaches have cooled enough to handle, chop them up into salsa-

appropriate-size pieces and then mix everything together. Let this all chill together for at least

30 minutes and then serve.



## Modifications
Grapeseed, regular sesame oil, or even olive oil would work here.
