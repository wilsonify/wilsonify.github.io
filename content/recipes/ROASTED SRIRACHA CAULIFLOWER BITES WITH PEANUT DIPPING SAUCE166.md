# ROASTED SRIRACHA CAULIFLOWER BITES WITH PEANUT DIPPING SAUCE



#### yields  4 TO 6 PEOPLE, OR 1 PERSON WITH NO FEARS


## ingredients
* 2 LB cauliflower 
* 1/2 cup flour 
* 1/2 cup water 
* 2 tsp oil 
* 0.5 to 2⁄3 cup Sriracha or similar-style hot sauce 
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar 
* 1/2 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1/4 cup warm water 
* 1/4 cup plus 2 TBL creamy peanut butter 
* 2 TBL rice vinegar 
* 2 TBL lime juice 
* 2 tsp minced fresh ginger 
* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 tsp maple syrup or agave syrup 
* 1 cucumber, cut into finger-long sticks 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 450°F. Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet. Chop up your cauliflower

into little trees no bigger than your thumb.

2 Whisk together the flour and water in a big bowl until a batter forms with no chunks. Did

you already fuck up and it’s all chunky? Start that shit over again. Toss in the cauliflower and

mix it around until all the pieces look a little coated. Spread the cauliflower out on the baking

sheet and roast for 15 minutes. Mix those fuckers around halfway through roasting so all the

sides get a little love.

3 Make the hot sauce. In a small saucepan, mix the oil, Sriracha, vinegar, and soy sauce. Heat

that over a low heat until the sauce is warm but not bubbling. Turn off the heat and leave it

alone.

4 Now it’s time for the peanut dipping sauce. In a medium glass, whisk together the water and

peanut butter until it looks all creamy. Add all the other ingredients and keep stirring until

everything is incorporated. Stick that in the fridge until it’s go time.

5 After 15 minutes in the oven, dump the cauliflower back in a big bowl and toss it with the

hot sauce mixture from the stovetop. Make sure everything is coated. Drop those

motherfuckers back on the baking sheet, leaving the extra sauce in the bowl, and roast for

another 3 minutes just so everything is warm and delicious.

6 Serve hot or at room temperature with the cucumber sticks and peanut dipping sauce on the

side.



## Modifications
All-purpose, whole wheat, or brown rice flour all work here. Use what you got.

 Olive oil, butter, or grapeseed oil are cool.

 If you like it hot, go for the 2⁄3 cup.
