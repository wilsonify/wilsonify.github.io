# CREAMY RAVIOLI WITH HOUSE MARINARA

## ingredients
* 2 cup all-purpose flour
* ½ cup flour
* 1 pinch salt
* ¾ to 1 cup water
* 3 TBL olive oil
* House Marinara
* Tofu Ricotta


# instructions
1 To make the dough: In a large bowl, combine the flours and salt and stir it all around. Make
a crater in the center of that and add ¾ cup of the water and the olive oil. Mix the liquids and
flour together until a shaggy dough comes together. If there’s still a bunch of dry-ass flour in
the bowl, add the remaining .25 cup water—but no more—1 TBL at a time until that
   comes together (it should be a little drier and less sticky than pizza dough). Once you’ve
got your ball of dough, knead it on a well-floured surface for 10 minutes so that    gets nice
and elastic. If you don’t do this, your dough will be pasty and gross, so don’t get lazy. Place the
dough back in the bowl, cover, and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes but up to 2
hours.
2 While the dough is resting, prepare the tofu ricotta and marinara.
3 To form the ravioli, you’ll need a ravioli stamp. First, cut the dough in half. On a well-
floured surface, roll out one piece to a rough rectangle that’s twice the width of your ravioli
stamp and about .125 inch thick. With a short end of the rectangle facing you, use the stamp to
imprint the dough with 2 side-by-side ravioli squares, fitting about 15 of these pairs down the
length of the rectangle. Fill each ravioli imprint on the left-hand side with 1 TBL of the
tofu ricotta. Using a pastry brush or paper towel, wet the dough along the edges of all the
stamps and fold the right-hand row over the left so that all the stamps line up and the filling is
completely covered (see this page for a pic). Stamp over each ravioli again until they are sealed,
then transfer to a large baking sheet. Repeat this process with the other piece of dough. (At
this point you can either freeze the ravioli or cook them immediately.)
4 To cook, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add the ravioli in batches of 8 to 10,
depending on the size of your pot. Boil gently until the raviolis float, 2 to 4 minutes.
5 Serve with the marinara.

# modifications

If you’re feeling lazy as   or are scared of making your own dough, you can cheat and just buy wonton
wrappers and use them instead. Skip the whole ravioli stamp and rolling out thing. Just place a little filling in the
center of a wonton wrapper, wet the edges, and press another wrapper over the top, making sure to seal the edges.
Freeze them or cook them right away just like the homemade   .
 That ravioli stamp shouldn’t be more than a couple bucks at the store and it’ll make this whole  process
easier. Or you can use a knife and just cut those bastards out if you are feeling brave. Just remember to wet your
fingers and press down the edges so the filling doesn’t spill out while you cook.
 Or just serve with your favorite sauce or with the basil pesto from the Mixed Mushroom and Spinach Lasagna
thinned out with a couple TBL of water.
