1 Cut the carrots and jalape単os into coins no thicker than .25 inch.
2 In a saucepan, bring the vinegars, herbs, spices, onion, garlic, and salt to a boil on the
stovetop. Add the carrots and jalape単os and simmer until they are slightly tender but still have
some crunch, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and pour into a large glass jar with a tight-
