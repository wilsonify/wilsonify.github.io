# instructions
0 chop onion and bell pepper
1 First, make the enchilada-ish sauce: Pour everything together in a medium saucepan and bring it to a gentle simmer—not a boil, a goddamn simmer—and cook for about 15 minutes to give the sauce a chance to thicken up a little. Turn off the heat and get making the filling. You should have about 2.5 cup.
2 Make the filling: In a large skillet or wok, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it starts to get golden, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and keep cooking for about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, jalapeño, black beans, and corn. Stir that all up and let everything in the pan warm back up, about 2 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt and keep cooking until the spices get all warm and start making your kitchen smell legit, about 1 minute. Fold in the pumpkin, lime juice, and maple syrup and cook for another minute so the pumpkin gets mixed up and warm. Turn off the heat.
3 Heat up your oven to 375°F. Grab an 9 x 13-inch baking dish.
4 Now it’s time to assemble this shit. Pour about ¾ cup of the enchilada-ish sauce all over the bottom of the baking dish. Cover that up with a single layer of tortillas. Yeah there will be some holes but just do your fucking best. Smear on a layer of the filling and try to keep that shit at an even thickness so you don’t have a lopsided dish. Cover that with another layer of tortillas and .5 cup sauce. Repeat. Cover with the remaining sauce.
5 Cover that shit in foil and bake for 15 minutes. Uncover it and bake for 10 more.
6 Serve warm with some salsa and avocado on the side.

# modifications

try agave instead of maple syrup
Not marinara, just canned, no-seasoning tomato sauce. Simple shit. Grab a low-sodium one if you can find it.
 You can use two 15-ounces cans of beans, drained and rinsed, because we know you are about the dump-and-stir life.
 Don’t accidently grab pumpkin pie filling at the store and think that shit will still work because it fucking won’t.
