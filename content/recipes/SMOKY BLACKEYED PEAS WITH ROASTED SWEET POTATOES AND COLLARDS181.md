<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>0 chop onion, celery, chipole peppers.<br>1 Rinse the black-eyed peas and throw out any grit or fucked-up looking peas. Put the peas in<br>a large bowl and cover them with a couple inches of water. Let them soak overnight or for at<br>least 6 hours. After soaking, drain the peas and start fucking cooking.<br>2 Before you start to cook the peas, crank your oven to 400°F. Grab your sweet potatoes and<br>stab the fuck out of them with a fork in a couple spots. This helps the steam release while they<br>roast and helps you get some of that stabbiness out your system. Put them on a baking sheet<br>and sit them in the oven until you can stick a knife through them without resistance, about 45<br>minutes.<br>3 Now back to the black-eyed peas. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the<br>onion and sauté that shit until it starts to brown in some places, about 5 minutes. Add the<br>celery and cook until it starts to get a little soft, about 2 minutes. Add the salt and spices and<br>sauté for 30 seconds. Add the garlic and chipotles to the pot and cook for another 30 seconds.<br>4 Toss the drained black-eyed peas into the pot along with the broth and bring that shit to a<br>simmer. Let it simmer uncovered until the peas are tender. This can take anywhere from 30<br>minutes to 1 hour depending on how long you soaked your peas and how old they are. If you<br>start running out of liquid before those are ready, add a little more broth or water. If the peas<br>are tender and you’ve still got too much broth in there, just drain some of that shit off. Not a<br>big fucking deal. Just check the seasoning when you are all done and add more herbs or spices if<br>you think it needs it.<br>5 Make your wilted collard greens right before the sweet potatoes are done roasting.<br>6 When the sweet potatoes are done, split them open lengthwise and fluff them with a fork.<br>Feel free to add a little butter and a pinch of salt to spice those sweet fuckers up.<br>Pour at least 1 cup of peas over the potatoes and 2 cup of the greens. Serve right away.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>This is not a blend of spices—it’s a berry with a confusing ass name. It is in a lot of Caribbean food and<br>should be right next to all the spices and shit in your store.<br> These smoked peppers in sauce are sold in a tiny can and are usually near the salsa and beans. When you chop<br>the chipotles, cut them open and scrape out the seeds. If you prefer it hot, then keep some of the seeds in, but think of<br>your butt hole tomorrow as you make that call.</p></div></div>
