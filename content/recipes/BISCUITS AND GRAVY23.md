# BISCUITS AND GRAVY


     

     






#### yields  4 TO 6


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup green or brown lentils 
* 5 cup water 
* Salt 
* 1/2 small onion 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* 1 tsp dried thyme 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1/8 tsp ground pepper 
* 1 TBL flour 
* 1 cup vegetable broth 
* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 tsp paprika 
* 1/2 tsp sherry or red wine vinegar 
* Whole Wheat Biscuits 



## Instructions
0 mince garlic and dice onion

1 Make the gravy: In a pot, bring the lentils, water, and a pinch of salt to a boil. Let those

bitches simmer until they are tender and kinda falling apart, about 40 minutes. Prep everything

else while you wait or you can do this    the night before and refrigerate.

2 In a small skillet, saut√© the onion in the olive oil over medium heat until golden around the

edges, about 3 minutes. Add the thyme, garlic, and pepper and cook for another 30 seconds.

Turn off the heat.

3 When the lentils are done, drain them of whatever water is left in there and throw them back

in the pot you cooked them in. In a small bowl, mix the flour into the broth. Then add the

broth mixture to the lentils along with the onions, soy sauce, paprika, and vinegar. Grab an

immersion blender and blend until smooth or throw it all in a regular blender and go to town.

Heat it all back up on the stove in that pot again and let it simmer to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes.

4 Split the warm biscuits in half and spoon some gravy all over them. Serve right away.
