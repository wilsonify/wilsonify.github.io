# STOVETOP HERB POPCORN
#### yields 4 TO 6, ABOUT 8 cup
## ingredients
* 2 tsp nutritional yeast* 2 tsp nutritional yeasts* 2 tsp nutritional yeast* 2 tsp nutritional yeast* 2 tsp nutritional yeasto* 2 tsp nutritional yeast* 2 tsp nutritional yeast* 2 tsp nutritional yeasteseed oil

* 1/2 cup dried corn kernels* 1/2 cup dried corn kernelse oil



* optional *
* 1/8 tsp salt


# instructions
1 Make the herb topping. Mix together the nutritional yeast, dried herbs, garlic powder, and
salt in a small bowl.
2 Make the popcorn: In a large stockpot, heat the high-heat oil over medium heat. Add a
couple kernels of corn, put on the lid, and shake it around every now and then. Once one of
them pops that means your pan is ready. This might take up to a minute and a half.
3 When the pan is hot, add the rest of the kernels and cover that fucker up with a lid. If you
have a glass lid, use that shit so you can spy on the corn. Shake the pan around every couple of
seconds to keep those bitches from burning. It’s like stirring without releasing all the heat. If
they don’t start popping within the first 30 seconds, turn your heat up just a bit. Soon it
should sound like fucking firecrackers are going off in your kitchen. Once you hear more than a
couple seconds between pops, turn off the heat. See, that took no time at all.
4 Pour the popcorn into a big bowl. Pour the olive oil all over that and stir it around to try
and get a bunch covered. Sprinkle in that herb blend and toss it around. Taste and add another
.125 tsp salt if that is your thing. This keeps for a couple days in an airtight container if
you have the self-control.

# modifications

This adds a vaguely cheesy taste to the popcorn and gives you that B12 boost.
