# TOFU RICOTTA



#### yields  2 cup


## ingredients
* 1 block (14 ounces) extra-firm tofu 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp grated lemon zest 
* 1 TBL lemon juice 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 3 to 4 clove garlic 
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast 



## Instructions
1 Pour the sunflower seeds into a food processor and run until that shit is in tiny-ass pieces.

2 Take the tofu out of its package and with your hands, squeeze out as much water as you can.

Add it to the food processor and run it until it is all mixed in with the sunflower seeds and

looks kinda smooth.

3 Dump that into a bowl with the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and garlic. Mix that

all together and then stir in the nutritional yeast. Done and done. Throw that in the fridge

until you need it. You can make this shit a day ahead of time if youâ€™re pressed for time.
