<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 In a large bowl, mix together the oats, ground flaxseed, and almond milk. Stir well to make<br>sure everything is covered and then let it sit for 10 minutes so that those oats soften up.<br>2 In a small bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Stir the<br>flour mixture into the wet oats and mix until all that shit is combined.<br>3 Now it’s time to cook these fuckers. Grab a skillet or griddle and heat it over medium heat.<br>Lightly grease the pan with some oil and pour some of the thick batter onto the griddle for<br>each cake. Cook the first side until the bottom looks golden brown and you can smell the<br>toasted oats, about 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking the other side until the cake looks<br>golden brown all over, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve warm with some blueberry sauce for a great<br>fucking time.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Not that instant bullshit. Real rolled oats.<br> This might sound fancy, but take some rolled oats, throw them in a blender or food processor, and run until that shit looks like flour. You can use all-purpose or whole wheat flour here too if it’s too early to be fucking with your blender.</p></div></div>
