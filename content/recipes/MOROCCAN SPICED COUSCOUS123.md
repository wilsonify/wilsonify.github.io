# MOROCCAN SPICED COUSCOUS

#### yields  2 TO 4 AS A SIDE


## ingredients

* 1 cup orange segments 



## Instructions
1 Mix the couscous, salt, and spices in a medium saucepot with a tight-fitting lid. Add the

boiling water to the couscous mix without splashing it around and burning the   out of

your hand. Stir everything up and quickly put on the lid. Let it rest for at least 8 minutes. The

couscous should absorb all the water while you wait and it should be tender when you take off

the lid. Easy   .

2 While your ass is waiting, mix together the olive oil and rice vinegar in a small glass. Chop

up the spinach into thick ribbons.

3 When the couscous is ready, stir it around with a fork to fluff it up, add the dressing to it,

and stir it up some more until it is mixed. Gently fold in the orange pieces and spinach. Season

to your  taste . Serve cold or at room temperature.



## Modifications
Shredded kale would be cool too.

 It takes about 5 small oranges to get there but if you have bigger oranges it should only take 1 or 2.
