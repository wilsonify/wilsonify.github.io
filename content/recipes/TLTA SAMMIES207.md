# TLTA SAMMIES



#### yields  4 SAMMIES ON REGULAR-SIZE LOAF BREAD


## ingredients
* 8 ounces tempeh 
* BACON-ISH MARINADE 
* 1 1/2 cup vegetable broth 
* 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari 
* 2 TBL apple cider vinegar 
* 2 TBL liquid smoke 
* 1 TBL blackstrap molasses 
* 1 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1 tsp onion powder 
* 3 clove garlic, sliced 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* Lettuce 
* Sliced tomatoes, avocado, and red onion 
* 8 slices bread, like sourdough, toasted 
* Dijon mustard 



## Instructions
1 Slice the tempeh into planks about .25 inch thick and 2 inches long. No need to fucking measure it out, just trust your 3rd grade teacher did an okay job with you and fucking eyeball it.

2 Next, make the bacon-ish marinade: Stir the broth, soy sauce or tamari, vinegar, liquid smoke, molasses, paprika, onion powder, and garlic together in a shallow dish, like a pie pan or some shit. Add the tempeh planks gently to the dish so you don’t splash everywhere and then just give up. The tempeh won’t all be covered, but just fucking make it work the best you can. Cover that up and stick it in the fridge to marinate for at least 2 hours and up to 8. Yeah, you’d better have read this shit all the way through before you started cooking hungry.

3 When the tempeh is ready, in a large skillet or wok, heat up the oil over medium heat. Lay the tempeh planks down in a single layer and cook them until they start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. When it starts to look a little dry in there, or if the tempeh feels like it might be sticking, just add a couple spoonfuls of the marinade to keep it all movin’.

4 Once the tempeh is browned on both sides, you are ready to make a badass sandwich. Pile lettuce, tomato, avocado, and red onions onto your favorite toasted bread with a little mustard. It’s a fucking sandwich. If you get this far in the recipe but fail at the assembling-a-sandwich part, then we honestly don’t know what the fuck to say to you.



## Modifications
WTF?

 Calm the fuck down. It’s a marinade, not a fucking drink. You won’t be consuming that much sodium, we swear.

 WTF?

 Confused? See the House Rules.

 We’re not gonna fucking tell you how to make toast. Forget it.
