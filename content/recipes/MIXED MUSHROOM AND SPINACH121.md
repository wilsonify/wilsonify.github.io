<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>0 chop garlic<br>1 Put all the ingredients for the pesto in a food processor and blend until smooth-ish. No<br>food processor? Chill the fuck out. Just put the almonds in a plastic bag and smash them up<br>with a rolling pin or a can until they are tiny, and chop the rest of that shit up super small, too.<br>Mix it with a fork until it looks like a paste. Set it aside.<br>2 To make the filling, remove any tough mushroom stems and slice up the mushrooms into<br>pieces no larger than a nickel. Heat the oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the<br>mushrooms and sauté for about 2 minutes. Fold in the spinach, add a small pinch of salt, and<br>continue cooking until all the spinach is wilted, about 3 more minutes. Turn off the heat and<br>stir in 2 TBL of the pesto. Taste and add more if you like. You know how you do.<br>3 Heat your oven to 375°F. Grab an 8 x 10-inch baking dish.<br>4 Cook the noodles according to the package directions. Ladle about 1 cup of the marinara<br>sauce into the bottom of the baking dish and lay down enough noodles to cover the bottom<br>with just a bit of overlap. Spread about one-third of the ricotta down, followed by one-third of<br>the mushroom filling, and then pour another cup of the sauce over top. Spread a spoonful or<br>two of the pesto over all of that and then do another layer of noodles. Repeat the whole process<br>until you run out of room and top with the final layer of noodles. Cover the noodles with the<br>remaining sauce. If you want to look extra fucking fancy, add sliced tomato rounds on top.<br>5 Cover that whole heavy motherfucker with foil and throw it in the oven for about 30<br>minutes. Gently take off the foil after that and bake it until the edges of the noodles start to<br>look a little golden, another 25 to 30 minutes. Let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before going to<br>town. Top with some of the remaining pesto and serve.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>You can do half and half or whatever.</p></div></div>
