</div><div class="ing"><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul class="ing"><li class="ing" itemprop="ingredients">6 large ears corn, shucked <iv itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 First you want to use a sharp knife to cut the corn off of the cobs. It’s easier if you snap the<br>cob in half, stand it on its end in the middle of a large bowl and cut the kernels off from top to<br>bottom. When you’re all done, you should have about 4 cup of kernels. Don’t get lazy and use<br>frozen corn here; that shit will not taste the same. Chop the onion, celery, bell pepper, and<br>potato into bean-size pieces and mince the garlic. Prep work done.<br>2 Now grab a large soup pot and heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until<br>it browns lightly, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, bell pepper, potato, and garlic and cook for<br>about 2 more minutes. Add the salt and then three-quarters of the corn kernels and stir. Add<br>the broth and let that son of a bitch simmer until the potato pieces are soft, about 10 minutes.<br>3 When the potato is soft, turn off the heat. Use an immersion blender and blend until that<br>motherfucker looks nice and creamy and without a bunch of chunks. (You could also pour it<br>into your blender and do it that way; up to you. Just return the blended soup to the pot.) Add<br>the rest of the corn and the lemon juice, and bring it back to a simmer. Turn off the heat, add<br>the basil, and then taste. Add more salt, more lemon juice, more basil, whatever. Serve right<br>away with some more basil on top to make that shit look as legit as it tastes.</p></div></div></div>
