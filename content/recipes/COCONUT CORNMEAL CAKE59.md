		<instructions>1 First, heat your oven to 375°F. Grab an 8-inch cake pan, grease it, and dust it with flour to
make sure your cake doesn’t stick. If you are still consumed with fear, cut a round out of
parchment paper the same size as the pan and stick that in the bottom to be extra fucking sure
your cake will come out in one piece. Now relax, you got this shit.
2 Get a big bowl and whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Make a crater in the center of the dry mixture and pour in the coconut milk, vanilla, and lemon
zest and stir it all up until there are no dry pockets and very few lumps.
3 Pour that batter into your cake pan that you prepped earlier because you followed the
goddamn directions. Let somebody else lick the spoon and the bowl because 1) The batter is
tasty as hell and
2) They will now owe you one. Cash in that favor the next time you need help moving. You’re
fucking welcome.
4 Bake the cake until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let it
cool in the pan for 15 minutes and then turn it out on to a wire rack to finish cooling until
you’re ready for it.
5 Serve cold or at room temperature.</instructions>

Got it?</modifications>
