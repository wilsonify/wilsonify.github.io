# PAN-ROASTED PEPPERS

## ingredients

* 1 pinch salt



## Instructions
1 Grab a large wok or skillet and heat up 1 TBL of the oil over high heat. Throw in half the peppers and stir them around every now and then. Keep cooking until the skins on the peppers look black in some places and they are starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Throw them in a medium bowl and repeat with the remaining peppers and oil.

2 When all the peppers are done, squeeze in a little lemon juice, mix, sprinkle in the salt, and toss again. Serve right away with some drinks handy.

Want to mix up the flavors? Replace the salt with a splash of soy sauce or tamari and .25 tsp toasted sesame oil and youâ€™ve got a whole new fucking dish. ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: SUPER SIMPLE BONUS RECIPE
