# BBQ BEAN BURRITOS WITH GRILLED PEACH SALSA

**Yields:** 6 BIG-ASS BURRITOS

## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 3 to 4 cloves garlic
- 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, plus 1 tablespoon of the sauce
- 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water
- 2 tablespoons orange juice
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce or tamari
- 3 cups cooked pinto beans
- 6 flour tortillas
- Baked Spanish Rice
- Shredded lettuce
- Grilled Peach Salsa
- Sliced avocado

## Instructions
1. **Make the BBQ beans:**
   - In a food processor or blender, combine onion, tomato paste, garlic, chipotle peppers and sauce, vegetable broth or water, orange juice, brown sugar, molasses, and soy sauce. Blend until a smooth sauce forms.
   - Pour the sauce into a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Fold in the cooked pinto beans and simmer until everything is warm and the beans absorb the flavors, 5 to 10 minutes.

2. **Assemble the burritos:**
   - Take a tortilla and fill it with a scoop of the BBQ beans, some baked Spanish rice, and a handful of shredded lettuce.
   - Top with grilled peach salsa and sliced avocado.
   - Serve immediately.

## Modifications
- Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce can be found in small cans near salsa and beans in most grocery stores.
- Use two 15-ounce cans of cooked pinto beans if you prefer not to cook them yourself.
