# LEMONY RED LENTIL SOUP

#### yields  4 AS A MAIN AND 6 AS A SIDE

## ingredients
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 0.5 yellow onion
* 1 russet potato
* 1 carrot
* 2 clove garlic
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* ½ tsp ground cumin
* ¼ tsp salt
* 2 cup red lentils, rinsed
* 6 cup vegetable broth
* ½ tsp grated lemon zest
* 1 TBL lemon juice
* ½ cup fresh cilantro (Optional)



## Instructions
0 chop onion and carrot; peel and dice potato

1 Grab a large soup pot and heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and let it sauté for

about 3 minutes, until it starts getting all soft and vaguely golden. Yeah, that’s right, “vaguely

golden,” motherfucker. Now add the potato and carrot. Sauté for another 2 minutes and then

add the garlic and spices. At this point, your place should start smelling choice. Sauté for

another 30 seconds and then add the salt, lentils, and broth.

2 Let the lentils simmer, uncovered, until they’re soft and kinda falling apart, 15 to 20

minutes. Stir this every now and then. Add the lemon zest and juice and turn off the heat. Now

you can stop if you prefer a chunky lentil soup, or you can blend half of it for a creamy chunky

hybrid thing. It’s your soup, so own that shit. The blended soup will thicken up if you throw

it back on the stove with some low heat for a minute or two, just watch. Magic, bitches.

3 Serve warm, topped with some chopped cilantro if you want.



## Modifications
Coriander is a super tasty seed of the cilantro plant, but it doesn’t taste a damn thing like cilantro; it’s on

another level. If you can’t find it at the store, just leave it out and use an extra .5 tsp cumin.
