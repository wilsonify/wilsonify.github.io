<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Make the crust: Heat your oven to 350°F. Grab a standard pie plate.<br>2 In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Crumble the<br>butter into the flour using your fingers and break up pieces bigger than a pea. It should<br>look kinda like coarse sand from a shitty playground. You can throw this all in your food<br>processor too, just run it until you get the same texture, and then put it in a bowl.<br>3 Pour in the olive oil and 2 TBL of the almond milk and stir it all up with a fork until<br>a shaggy dough comes together. If it still looks dry, add the remaining TBL of milk.<br>Press the dough into the pie plate so that it’s even and going up the sides. You know how a pie<br>crust should look. (At this point, you can stick that shit in the fridge to bake later or get<br>right down to business. Your call.)<br>4 Line the inside of your crust with foil and pour a bunch of dried beans in there that you<br>aren’t planning on eating. This weird shit keeps the crust in place while it bakes. Trust the<br>system. Throw this in the oven for 12 minutes, then pull it out and remove the foil and beans.<br>Stick it back in the oven until the bottom looks cooked and the edges are golden, another 12<br>to 15 minutes. Let it cool while you make the filling.<br>5 Make the custard filling: In a medium saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch, sugar, and<br>salt. Slowly whisk in around .33 cup of the coconut milk, making sure there aren’t any clumps.<br>Once all the starch is dissolved, whisk in the remaining coconut milk, the almond milk, and<br>vanilla.<br>6 Put the pot over medium-high heat and keep whisking until the mixture is bubbling and you<br>can feel it start to thicken to sort of a gravy texture, about 5 minutes. Now, turn down the<br>heat to medium-low and grab a spatula. Keep the pot at a very gentle simmer and keep scraping<br>the bottom and sides with a spatula to avoid pudding skin. That shit is gross. Keep this up for<br>7 to 10 minutes or until you flick some of the custard across the top of itself in the pot and<br>that spot holds its shape for a couple seconds. Gross but fucking accurate.<br>7 Your pie crust should be cool enough to handle now. Slice up the bananas into rounds no<br>thicker than .5 inch. Line the crust with the banana slices, like all over the fucking place. Up<br>the sides, BANANAS EVERYWHERE. Now pour the warm custard into the banana-lined<br>pie shell. Cover and place this fucker in the fridge for at least 3 hours.<br>8 Once the custard has cooled and set, spread on a batch of the whipped cream over the top<br>and serve. This pie is best eaten within 3 days of being made because the bananas cannot be<br>trusted to keep their shit together much longer than that.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>You can use whole wheat pastry, all-purpose, or a combo here. All of it will work.<br> You don’t want the oil all runny and melted. It should look milky and have a consistency similar to room<br>temp butter. If it’s hot in your place, stick that shit in the fridge for a minute or two to cool down.</p></div></div>
