# OAT FLOUR GRIDDLE CAKES WITH BLUEBERRY SAUCE



#### yields  8 TO 10 GRIDDLE CAKES


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup rolled oats 
* 2 TBL ground flaxseed 
* 1 1/2 cup plain almond or other nondairy milk 
* 1/2 cup oat flour 
* 1 TBL sugar 
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 
* 1 TBL butter 
* Blueberry Sauce (recipe opposite) 



## Instructions
1 In a large bowl, mix together the oats, ground flaxseed, and almond milk. Stir well to make

sure everything is covered and then let it sit for 10 minutes so that those oats soften up.

2 In a small bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Stir the

flour mixture into the wet oats and mix until all that    is combined.

3 Now it’s time to cook these  ers. Grab a skillet or griddle and heat it over medium heat.

Lightly grease the pan with some oil and pour some of the thick batter onto the griddle for

each cake. Cook the first side until the bottom looks golden brown and you can smell the

toasted oats, about 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking the other side until the cake looks

golden brown all over, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve warm with some blueberry sauce for a great

 time.



## Modifications
Not that instant bull  . Real rolled oats.

 This might sound fancy, but take some rolled oats, throw them in a blender or food processor, and run until that    looks like flour. You can use all-purpose or whole wheat flour here too if it’s too early to be  with your blender.
