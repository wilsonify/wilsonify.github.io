# Pork Chops With Apples and Cider

#### Yields: 4 servings  
#### Cook time: 1 hour  

## Ingredients
- 1/4 tsp black peppercorns  
- 3 cloves  
- 4 allspice berries  
- 2 tbsp roughly chopped sage  
- 1 1/2 tbsp kosher salt  
- 6 boneless pork chops (about 4 oz each, 1/2-inch thick)  
- 2 large apples  
- 2 tbsp butter, divided  
- All-purpose flour, for dusting  
- 1/2 cup hard cider, plus 2 tbsp  
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard  
- 1 1/2 cups chicken broth  
- 2 tsp potato starch dissolved in 2 tbsp cold water  
- 3 tbsp crème fraîche  
- 1 tbsp Calvados, apple brandy, or Cognac (optional)  
- 2 tbsp finely cut chives  
- 2 tbsp chopped parsley  

## Instructions

1. **Make the spice salt**  
   Grind the peppercorns, cloves, allspice, and sage in a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the salt. Season the pork chops on both sides with this mixture. (Reserve some of the mixture to season the sauce later.) Cover and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.  

2. **Cook the apples**  
   Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then cut each into 12 wedges. Heat 1 tbsp butter in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apple wedges in one layer and brown gently for about 2 minutes per side, until golden and just tender. Remove from pan and keep warm.  

3. **Cook the pork chops**  
   Add the remaining 1 tbsp butter to the skillet and melt. Lightly dust the pork chops with flour, then sear for about 4 minutes per side, adjusting heat to prevent overcooking. Remove chops to a platter and keep warm in a low oven. Discard excess butter from the pan.  

4. **Make the sauce**  
   Pour 1/2 cup cider into the pan, raise heat to high, and reduce to a syrup. Stir in mustard and chicken broth, then bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Whisk in the potato starch slurry until the sauce thickens, then stir in crème fraîche. Season with the reserved spice salt, add the remaining 2 tbsp cider, and stir in Calvados (if using). Cook for 1 minute more.  

5. **Serve**  
   Spoon the sauce over the pork chops, arrange the apples around the platter, and garnish with chives and parsley.
