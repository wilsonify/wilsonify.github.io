# CORNMEAL WAFFLES WITH STRAWBERRY SYRUP

#### yields  4 BIG-ASS WAFFLES, BUT THIS VARIES DEPENDING ON


## ingredients
* 1 LB strawberries 
* 2-4 TBL sugar 


## Instructions

1 First, make that sweet syrup: Cut the stems off the strawberries and chop the berries into

bean-size pieces. Throw them in a small saucepan with the rest of the syrup ingredients and

warm it all over a medium-low heat. At first it might not look like there’s enough liquid in

this bitch to make syrup, but once everything gets going the strawberries will fix that shit.

Trust. Stir it around and bring it to a gentle simmer. Let it go for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring

every minute or so, until the syrup thickens up and the liquids begin to evaporate. Turn off the

heat.

2 While your syrup is cooling, make your waffles: Heat up the waffle iron. Mix together the

milk and vinegar in a small glass and set it aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal,

flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon so that they are all combined. Make a

crater in the center and add the milk mixture and the oil. Whisk everything together until

there aren’t any more dry spots and only a few lumps. Coat the plates of the preheated waffle

iron with some cooking spray so those bitches won’t stick, then pour in some batter. Cook

until golden brown according to your waffle maker’s directions. Cover with strawberry syrup

and serve hot.



## Modifications
Fresh strawberries are best but frozen will do as long as you thaw that shit out.

 Add the 4 TBL if your strawberries aren’t that sweet or if you like a sweet-ass syrup.

 Same shit that you would use to make cornbread. Sometimes it’s called corn flour in the store. Just don’t buy

polenta and you’ll be cool.
