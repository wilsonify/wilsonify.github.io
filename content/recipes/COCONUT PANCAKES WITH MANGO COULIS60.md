# COCONUT PANCAKES WITH MANGO COULIS



## ingredients
* 2 mangoes, cut into cubes 
* 2-4 TBL sugar 
* 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice 
* 2 1/4 cup sweetened vanilla nondairy milk or coconut milk 
* 1/2 tsp lemon juice or apple cider vinegar 
* 1 TBL ground flaxseed 
* 2 cup flour, all-purpose flour, or a mix 
* 1/2 cup shredded coconut, toasted 
* 3 TBL brown sugar 
* 2 tsp baking soda 
* 1/8 tsp salt 
* Spray oil 
* fresh-cut fruit 



## Instructions
1 To make the coulis: Throw everything in a food processor or blender and let that  er run until it’s nice and smooth. Pour it into a container and stick it in the fridge until the pancakes are ready. This will keep for a couple days so make this    ahead of time and get it out of the way.

2 Make the pancakes: In a medium glass, mix together the milk, lemon juice, and ground flax and then set that    aside.

3 In a big bowl, whisk together the flour, coconut, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Make a crater in the middle of the dry mix and pour in the milk. Mix that all together until there are no more dry spots but don’t go crazy. Mixing it too much will make your pancakes tough, so try and just chill. No need to start your day off with a pancake panic attack.

4 Now, you probably know what to do when it comes to cooking up some pancakes, but in case this is your first time doing this    yourself, keep reading. Grab a skillet or griddle and warm it over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with some spray oil and pour some pancake batter onto the griddle for each pancake you want. Cook the first side until bubbles appear on top, 2 to 3 minutes. The bubbles mean your pancake has cooked through. Flip and cook the other side until it turns golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.

5 Serve warm, spread with a little butter and with mango coulis all over and some fresh fruit on the side. Sprinkle on some extra toasted coconut if you want people to know exactly how you like to get your day started.

6 top with fresh-cut fruit, like bananas, strawberries, or extra mangos; a smear of butter



## Modifications
Can’t find a ripe mango? Don’t  stress. Thawed frozen mango (2 cup) works good too.

 If your mango is superripe and delicious, you might not need any sugar, as the amount to use is directly correlated to the   tiness of your mango. Taste and you’ll  know what to do.

 Grab the unsweetened coconut, not that supergross sugary   . To toast it, just throw it in a small skillet over medium-low heat and stir it around until it starts to look sorta golden and smell nice and nutty.  done. Can’t find any shredded coconut? Just leave that    out and add .5 cup of flour instead.
