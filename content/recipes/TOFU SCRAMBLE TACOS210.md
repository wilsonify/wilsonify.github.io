# TOFU SCRAMBLE TACOS



#### yields  8 TACOS


## ingredients
* 1 small crown broccoli 
* 1 red bell pepper 
* 1 yellow onion 
* 1 carrot 
* 4 clove garlic 
* 1-2 jalapeños 
* 1 TBL ground cumin 
* 1 TBL chili powder 
* 2 tsp dried oregano 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 block extra-firm tofu 
* 2-3 tsp soy sauce 
* 2 TBL lemon or lime juice 
* 1/3 cup nutritional yeast 
* 2 tsp hot sauce 
* 8 tortillas 



## Instructions
1 Chop up the broccoli into pieces no larger than a nickel, aiming for about 2 cup. Dice the

bell pepper and onion into pea-size pieces. Shred the carrot on that box grater you think you

bought a while back. Mince the garlic and jalapeño. In a small bowl, mix together the cumin,

chili powder, and oregano and set that shit aside. PREP WORK, MOTHERFUCKER.

2 Now it’s time to cook. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and

cook until it starts to look golden around the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Now add the chopped

broccoli and bell pepper and cook until the broccoli starts to get tender but isn’t all fucking

limp, another 3 to 4 minutes. Don’t overcook this shit or your broccoli will taste like little

soggy trees. Now add the garlic and jalapeño and sauté for about 30 seconds.

3 While that shit is going on, drain the tofu and squeeze out as much water as possible. (You

can just use your hands; no need to press this bastard.) Now crumble that tofu into the pan in

quarter-size chunks. Some small bits are cool but the more you stir it, the more shit is going

to break down, so its better to start bigger and work to smaller, you know? Sauté that tofu

around with the veggies for 2 to 3 minutes and try to get it all mixed in. If the pan starts

looking dry, add a splash of water and move the fuck on. Add the soy sauce and lemon/lime

juice all over the pan. Add the spice blend, shredded carrot, and nutritional yeast right after

and stir those fuckers in. Let this all cook together for about 2 minutes so that the flavors

blend. Top with the hot sauce, stir, and then pile the filling into your waiting tortillas.

Breakfast is served, bitches.

Serve with avocados, fresh cilantro, and your favorite salsa. Fuck yeah.
