# PUMPKIN CHILI

#### yields  4 TO 6 PEOPLE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THEY LIKE CHILI

## ingredients
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 carrot
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 2 to 3 clove garlic
* 1 jalapeño, minced
* 2 tsp soy sauce or tamari
* 2 ½ TBL mild chili powder
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 can (14.5 ounces) low-salt diced tomatoes
* 1 ½ cup pureed pumpkin
* 2 cup vegetable broth or water
* 3 cup cooked beans
* 1 TBL lime juice
* Toppings: cilantro, onion, jalapeños, avocado, tortilla strips

## Instructions
1 Chop up the onion, carrot, and bell pepper into pieces no bigger than a bean.

2 In a big soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, and bell pepper and

sauté them until they begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, jalapeno, soy sauce, and

spices and cook that all together for another 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, pumpkin, broth,

and beans and stir that up so everything is mixed. Get those flavors mingling and shit. Turn

down the heat, cover, and let that simmer together for about 15 minutes. Stir it around every

now and then.

3 When it is done simmering, turn off the heat and stir in the lime juice. Serve right away with

your favorite toppings.



## Modifications
Fire-roasted tomatoes are damn delicious if you can find them.

 You can buy canned pumpkin puree or cut up a fresh pumpkin into chunks, steam it until it is tender, and puree

the fuck out of it until you have 1.5 cup. If you try to make this chili with pumpkin pie filling, don’t complain

about how fucked up it tastes. You did that dumb shit yourself.

 Whatever beans you prefer in chili are cool, but if you need direction, half black bean and half pinto make a

solid combo. And yeah, you can use two 15-ounce cans.
