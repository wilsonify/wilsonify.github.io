* 3 medium leeks* 3 medium leeksl

* 3 to 4 clove garlic to 4 clove garlic
* 4 cup vegetable broth* 4 cup vegetable broth* 4 cup vegetable broth* 4 cup vegetable broth* 4 cup vegetable broth fresh chives or green onions

* 1/4 cup fresh dill

# instructions
1 Chop the potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Keep the skin on if you like to go hard. Cut off the
rough, leafy ends of the leeks and save that shit to make broth later (see this page). Cut off the
roots and then slice that fucker up the middle lengthwise. Now cut the leek crosswise into
ribbons about as thin as a hair tie and wash the fuck out of them.
2 Heat the oil up in a stockpot over medium heat. Add the clean leeks and sauté those guys
around until they start to soften up, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the potatoes and garlic and stir to
combine. Pour in the vegetable broth and salt. Bring all of that to a boil, then cover it and
reduce the heat to a simmer. Let that go until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
3 When everything is good and soft, you’re going to want to blend the fuck out of it. You can
let it cool for a bit and then add it to your blender, or you can stick your immersion blender
right in there and get that shit down in a sec. Do whatever you can. Once the soup is nice and
creamy, add it back to the pot (if you took it out), add the pepper, and warm it back up. Stir in
the chives and taste. Add more salt and pepper if you think it needs it. That shit is on you.
Dish that soup up and serve with about a TBL of the fresh dill on top. Tasty and classy.

# modifications

About 1 LB
 Leeks are always dirty as hell when you buy them because they grow in sandy soil and can be hard to clean
when they are whole. Instead, cut them up to the size you need them, throw them in a bowl of water, and mix that
shit around so that all the dirt comes loose and sinks to the bottom. Drain it and rinse a couple more times so you
aren’t eating any grit with dinner.
