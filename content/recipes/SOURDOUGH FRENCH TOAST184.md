# Sourdough French Toast

*Cooking spray*

## Instructions

1. In a pie pan or similar shallow dish, mix together the ground chia seeds and flour.  
   Slowly whisk in the milk so that it doesn’t get lumpy. Let that sit for 15 minutes.  
   Cut the bread into 1-inch-thick slices.

2. After 15 minutes, whisk the batter again and slowly add the nutritional yeast. Stir well.  
   Heat a griddle or heavy pan over medium heat and coat with a little cooking spray.  
   Soak your bread slices in the batter for a couple seconds on each side, then place them on the griddle.  
   Cook for 1–2 minutes per side, or until golden and tasty all over.

## Modifications

- Makes about 6 pieces of French toast.
