# Artichoke Dip

#### Yields 2 Cups, Enough for 4 People

## Ingredients
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup unsweetened plain nondairy milk
- 1 1/2 tsp soy sauce
- 1/4 cup sliced almonds
- 1 can (14 ounces) water-packed artichoke hearts, drained and rinsed
- 2 TBL flour
- 2 TBL olive oil
- 1/2 cup vegetable broth
- 1 cup fresh spinach
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 1 TBL lemon juice

## Instructions

1. In a blender or food processor, combine onion, garlic, milk, and soy sauce. Pulse until it forms a paste. Add almonds and pulse until no big pieces remain. Add artichokes and pulse until it reaches the desired chunkiness (smooth if preferred).

2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir oil and flour until toasted and nutty-smelling, about 2 minutes. Whisk in broth until it thickens (like Play-Doh). Add the artichoke mixture and spinach. Keep stirring until everything thickens, and the spinach wilts, about 3 minutes.

3. Add nutritional yeast and lemon juice, heat for another minute. Taste and adjust with more lemon juice, garlic, or other seasonings.

4. Serve warm or at room temperature with your preferred dip transportation device.

## Modifications

Flour can be all-purpose or whole wheat
