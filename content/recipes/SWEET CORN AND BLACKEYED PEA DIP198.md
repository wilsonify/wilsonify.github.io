# SWEET CORN AND BLACK-EYED PEA DIP



#### yields  4 TO 6, ABOUT 5 cup


## ingredients
* 1 red bell pepper 
* 1 small tomato 
* 3 cup cooked black-eyed peas 
* 1 cup raw corn kernels 
* 1/2 cup sliced green onions 
* 1/3 cup cilantro 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1 jalapeño, minced 
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 2 TBL lime juice 
* 2 TBL red wine vinegar 
* 1/4 tsp ground cumin 
* 1/4 tsp salt 



## Instructions
1 Chop up the bell pepper and tomato into pieces about the size of a bean.

2 Add the black-eyed peas to a large bowl and smash them just a little bit. You want roughly

one-third of them smashed up; the rest can stay whole. This just adds an extra creaminess to

the dip, but you can skip it if you are over the whole mashed bean thing.

3 Mix in the pepper and tomato and everything else, stir, and taste. Easy. Add more lime juice

or salt if you think it needs it. Serve this as a dip or over some greens for a  bomb-ass

salad.



## Modifications
Two 15-ounce cans if you really don’t like saving money.

 That should be about 1 cob’s worth. Sigh.
