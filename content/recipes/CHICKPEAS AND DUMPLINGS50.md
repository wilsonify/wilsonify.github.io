<li class="ing" itemprop="ingredients">Salt fucked up sizes because that’s how shit is, but don’t stress. They will be fine. You should get<br>around 70 dumplings. Stack them up on a floured plate and stick them in the fridge uncovered.<br>3 Make the soup: Remove the hard stems from the kale and slice those leaves into 1-inch<br>ribbons. Set aside until the very end. In a large soup pot, heat up the 2 tsp oil over<br>medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and sauté until the onions start to brown, 5<br>to 7 minutes. Add the carrots and celery and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the broccoli and<br>garlic and cook until the carrots are getting soft but the broccoli still has some bite, another 3<br>minutes. Turn off the heat and dump all that shit into a medium bowl and set it aside. Make<br>sure to scrape out all the veggies because you are reusing that pot. Fuck extra dishes.<br>4 Mix the oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and .25 tsp salt together<br>in a small cup. Warm that soup pot back up over medium heat, add the remaining .25 cup oil,<br>and whisk in the flour. It should look somewhere between glue and runny paste. Yum? Keep<br>stirring that shit around until it smells kinda nutty and looks a little toasted, about 2 minutes.<br>Toss in the spice mixture and keep stirring for another 30 seconds. Whisk in the white wine.<br>The flour will ball up with the wine and make it look like frosting or some shit like that.<br>Slowly whisk in 2 cup of the broth. Mix that up until it is all incorporated and starts to look<br>thick, like movie theater nacho cheese. Slowly whisk in the next 4 cup of broth and make sure<br>it’s smooth with no chunks of flour. Whisk in the remaining 4 cup broth and let it simmer,<br>whisking every minute or so, for about 15 minutes. The broth should thicken up and start to<br>look and taste kind of velvety. You know what the fuck we are talking about. Try it. Fucking<br>awesomeness without 2 sticks of butter.<br>5 With the pot still simmering, add the dumplings a couple at a time so they don’t get all<br>stuck together in a clusterfuck of dough and dying dreams. Once they are all in, gently stir<br>them around once so that everybody is bobbing around in the broth. Let them simmer<br>together for 3 minutes so that the pot gets a chance to warm back up. Add the chickpeas and<br>sautéed veggies and let them all simmer together for about 10 more minutes or until the<br>dumplings don’t taste raw.<br>6 Once your dumplings are on point, add the green peas and sliced kale. Yeah, that’s right,<br>just dump the peas in frozen because who gives a fuck? Cook for another 2 minutes so that the<br>peas warm up and the kale wilts. Turn off the heat and throw in .25 cup of those chives from<br>earlier. Taste that shit and see if you want more herbs, spices, or salt to get it where you love<br>it. Serve immediately and top the bowls with some of whatever chives you have left.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Whole wheat flour is a little too dense for these fuckers, but give it a go if that’s what you got and you are feeling<br>brave.<br> Spinach or collards will work here too.<br> Whateverthefuck you like to drink will work. Out of wine? Just use broth.<br> About two 15-ounce cans if you aren’t cooking your own.</p></div></div>
