		<instructions>1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Grab a baking sheet and coat it lightly with cooking spray.
2 Peel the plantain and cut it crosswise into slices no thicker than .125 inch. Don’t measure
that shit, just think thin.
3 Grab two bowls and put the oil and lime juice in one. Add the plantain and mix all around
until every last motherfucking piece gets covered. Fish out the plantains and place them in the
second bowl. Add the spices and salt and fucking mix that up until all the plantains have some
seasoning on them.
4 Lay them out in a single layer on the baking sheet and bake them for 20 minutes, flipping
them halfway. They will be golden and crispy when they are ready to go. They are best eaten the
day they are made for crisp retention. Yeah that’s right, crisp retention, some highbrow shit right
there.</instructions>
		<modifications>Plantains are like big, starchy bananas. Look for them in any market that specializes in Latin American foods.</modifications>
