# ROASTED BROCCOLI AND MILLET PILAF



#### yields  4 AS A SIDE


## ingredients
* 1 crown broccoli 
* 1 tsp plus 1 TBL olive oil 
* 1 cup uncooked millet 
* 2 cup water 
* Salt 
* pepper 
* 5 clove roasted garlic 
* 1 TBL lemon juice 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Grab a rimmed baking sheet.

2 Cut the broccoli into chunks no bigger than your thumb. Toss the broccoli with 1 tsp

of the oil, pour it in one layer on the baking sheet, and roast the broccoli until it looks a little

charred, about 20 minutes.

3 While the broccoli is roasting, make the millet. Grab a medium saucepan and throw it over a

medium heat, no oil needed. Add the millet and stir it around until it smells toasted or until

you’re over it, about 2 minutes. This helps the millet taste nuttier and more awesome, but if

you don’t give a damn about depth of flavor, you could just move the fuck on. Pour in the

water and a pinch of salt and bring this all to a boil. Now turn down the heat so that the pot is

at a simmer, cover it, and let it go until the millet is tender, about 25 minutes.

4 You should have a couple minutes to make the sauce before all that finishes up. Grab a glass

and smash the roasted garlic clove around in the bottom of it until a paste forms. Add the

lemon juice, remaining 1 TBL olive oil, and .25 tsp salt until it looks like a really

thick sauce/paste hybrid. Done.

5 When the millet is ready, pour it into a large bowl and add the roasted garlic sauce. Stir

everything around really well and then fold in the broccoli. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or

lemon juice to suit your tastes. Serve this simple side dish warm or at room temperature.
