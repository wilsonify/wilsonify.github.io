* 2 TBL olive oil* 2 TBL olive oilo* 2 TBL olive oil* 2 TBL olive oil* 2 TBL olive oile

* 1 TBL apple cider vinegar or lemon juice

# instructions
1 Grab a small saucepot and warm up the oil over a medium heat. Add the flour and stir that shit up until it starts smelling nutty, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the broth. It will start looking like gross Play-Doh, but keep going. Slowly whisk in the hot sauce and cider vinegar to keep it from getting chunky. Simmer until the sauce starts to thicken up, 2 to 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.

# modifications

Frankâ€™s Red Hot is traditional, but do whatever basic vinegar red hot sauce you can find at the store.
