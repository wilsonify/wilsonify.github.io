		<instructions>1 In a big container or pitcher, stir together the wine, brandy, and fruit. (Don’t peel the fruit. Just throw it all in there.) Stick this in the fridge to chill for at least an hour or as long as overnight.
2 When it’s time to get down, add the sparkling wine or water and serve chilled with all the fruit still floating around.</instructions>
		<modifications>You want a white wine that’s a little sweet but not syrupy and disgusting. Does the tag say it tastes like it already has some fruit in it? Kickass, just use that. The options in the wine aisle can be enough to induce a goddamn panic attack, so just keep it simple.</modifications>
