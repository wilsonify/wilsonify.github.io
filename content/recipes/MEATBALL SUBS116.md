# MEATBALL SUBS



#### yields  6 SUBS (ABOUT 24 MEATBALLS, IF YOU DO THAT SHIT RIGHT)


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup cooked kidney beans 
* 1 1/2 cup cooked brown lentils 
* 1/4 cup onion 
* 1/3 cup whole wheat bread crumbs 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast or flour 
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 1 TBL soy sauce or tamari 
* 2 tsp seasoning blend 
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano 
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme 
* 1/2 tsp grated lemon zest 
* Quick Blender Marinara 
* 2 baguettes 
* Arugula, for serving 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Spray a baking sheet with oil.

2 Mash up the beans and lentils in a large bowl until they form a paste. Some whole bean bits are cool, but try to keep that shit to a minimum. Stir in the rest of the ingredients for the balls and mix it all up so that everything gets distributed. You might need to use your hands because it’s just the best fucking way to do this with a quickness. You can use a spoon if you want, but we’ll be silently judging you. If the stuff you are mixing up feels a little dry, add a TBL or two of water.

3 Roll the mixture into balls about the size of a golf ball and put them on the baking sheet. You should get 20 to 25 depending on your rolling skills. Coat them lightly with oil and bake, turning them over halfway, until both sides are golden brown, about 30 minutes.

4 While the balls are cooking, make the marinara. The sauce is gonna keep our balls nice and moist.

5 When the balls are almost ready to go, throw the sauce into a medium saucepan and warm it up over medium heat. Cut your rolls or bread in half and throw them in the oven with the balls to warm up for a minute.

6 When all that shit is ready, assemble your subs. Spoon a little marinara on the bottom half of the bread, put 3 or 4 meatballs on top, lather those bastards in marinara sauce to your liking, add a handful of arugula for color, then top it off with the other half of the bread. Get it down immediately or someone is going to eat that fucker for you.



## Modifications
Or one 15-ounce can of beans, drained and rinsed.

 No clue how to do this shit? See Basic Pot of Beans.

 White, yellow, or sweet onion will do. Whatever is on sale.

 WTF?

 No clue how to zest?
