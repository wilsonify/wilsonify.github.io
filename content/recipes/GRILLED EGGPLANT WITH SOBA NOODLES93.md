Place the eggplant in a large pan of some kind and pour the marinade over that shit.<br>Let the eggplant marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour if you’ve got the fucking<br>time.<br>2 While the eggplant marinates, cook the soba noodles according to the package directions.<br>Drain the noodles and rinse them with cool water so that they aren’t still cooking. Place them<br>in a large bowl and add the toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar. Stir it all up.<br>3 Bring your grill or grill pan to a medium heat (around 300° to 350°F). Oil the grill grates.<br>When the eggplant is done marinating, grill the eggplant slices (but don’t throw away that<br>marinade) on each side 2 to 3 minutes or until you see some grill marks. If the eggplant begins<br>to look a little dry, take the slices and dip them in or brush them with the remaining marinade<br>and continuing cooking them until done. Eggplant hydration. Boom.<br>4 When all of the eggplant is done cooking and has cooled slightly, cut it up into .5-inch<br>squares. Mix together .5 cup of the leftover marinade and the 3 TBL of water. Pour<br>that mess all over the noodles and mix. Toss in the eggplant and basil and mix again. Top with<br>sesame seeds and serve at room temperature or cold.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>You can use whole wheat pasta or whatever here, but soba noodles—made of buckwheat flour—taste way fucking<br>better.</p></div></div>
