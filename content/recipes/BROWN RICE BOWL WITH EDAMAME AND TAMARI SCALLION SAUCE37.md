# BROWN RICE BOWL WITH EDAMAME AND TAMARI SCALLION SAUCE



#### yields  4 TO 6


## ingredients
* 1 cup sliced green onions 
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar 
* 2 TBL orange juice 
* 4 tsp toasted sesame oil 
* 1 tsp tamari or soy sauce 
* 1 Pot Brown Rice 
* 4 cup shelled edamame 
* 1/3 cup sliced almonds (optional)



## Instructions
1 Make the sauce: Throw everything into a food processor or blender and let it run until the

sauce looks sorta smooth. You should get about 2⁄3 cup of sauce.

2 To assemble the bowl, spoon equal parts brown rice and edamame into a bowl and drizzle a

TBL or two of sauce all over it. If you aren’t super hungry in the mornings, .5 cup of

each should do you. If you want some added crunch, sprinkle some sliced almonds over the top.

You can make this shit all on Sunday night and then just heat it up all week for breakfast.



## Modifications
Green onions, scallions . . . they’re the same damn thing. “Scallion” just sounds more legit next to the word

“sauce.”

 Edamame are immature soybeans and are tasty as fuck. They have a great texture and are full of good shit like

protein, fatty acids, and tons of fiber. Find them in the frozen veggie section at the store and keep your freezer full.
