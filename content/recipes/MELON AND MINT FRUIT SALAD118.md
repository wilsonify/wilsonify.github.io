## ingredients
* 2 small melons* 2 small melons * 2 small melons* 2 small melons
* 1 TBL minced fresh mint

# instructions
0 chop melons into chunks no bigger than a nickel (about 10 cup)
1 Mix the melon, lemon zest, sugar, and mint together in a big ass bowl. Let this chill in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours, or you can let it hang out overnight. If you’re going for the longer chill, leave the mint out until you’re ready to serve so that green is still looking all nice and fresh.
2 Serve cold and appreciate how badass melons are.

# modifications

We like to do a combo of cantaloupe and honeydew, but use whatever the hell is ripe when you run to the store. All the same melon is chill too if you’re super into cantaloupe or whatever.
 So fucking fancy. Lost?
 You can leave this sugar out if your melons are just that fucking good, but this shit helps them release a little extra juice and sweetness in case you got one that’s doing you dirty.
