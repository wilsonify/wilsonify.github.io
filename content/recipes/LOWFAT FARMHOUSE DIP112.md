* 1/2 tsp salt

* 1/2 tsp garlic powder

# instructions
1 Throw the tofu, shallot, and garlic into a blender or food processor and run until it looks all smooth. Throw in the rest of the ingredients and pulse it a couple of times so everything gets chopped up and mixed in but the herbs are still kinda visible.
2 Let it sit in the fridge at least 1 hour before serving so that the flavors can get to know each other. Serve with whatever vegetables you like and get to dipping. It will keep for 3 to 4 days in the fridge.
WANT TO MAKE IT A DRESSING?
Just add 2 TBL of unsweetened plain almond milk to the blender to make it easier to pour later. Fucking done.

WTF?
 We know it’s strange to call for two kinds of garlic, but there’s a good goddamn reason. This helps give it that store-bought ranch taste that you grew up with. Trust us.
