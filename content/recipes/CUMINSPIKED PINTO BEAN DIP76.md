# instructions
0 chop onion
1 Heat the oil up in a sauté pan and cook the onions until they begin to brown around the
edges, about 4 minutes. Add 1 TBL of the cumin and all of the cayenne pepper and cook
for another 30 seconds. This part should smell pretty  good. Turn off the heat and let
that mix cool for a minute.
2 Drop the onions, beans, broth, lime juice, and the last .5 TBL of the cumin into a
food processor and let that  er rip until it’s creamy. No food processor? Just smash all that
up until it has a consistency you can deal with. Taste and add a pinch or two of salt if you think
it needs it.
