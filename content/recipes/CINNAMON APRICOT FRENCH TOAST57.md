# CINNAMON APRICOT FRENCH TOAST

#### yields 6 PIECES OF FRENCH TOAST

## ingredients
* 2 cup sweetened vanilla nondairy milk
* 1/4 cup packed dried apricots
* 1/4 tsp grated orange zest *optional*
* 1 TBL ground flaxseed or chia seeds
* 1 1/2 tsp nutritional yeast
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* Spray oil
* 1/2 loaf day-old crusty bread, cut into six .5-inch-thick slices

# instructions
1 Make the batter: Grab a small saucepan and dump in the milk and apricots. Let that    simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes and then let it cool for another 5.
2 Pour the cooled milk/apricot mixture into a blender with the orange zest (if using) and ground flaxseeds. Blend until it looks mostly smooth.
3 Pour the batter from the blender into a pie pan or similar-size shallow dish and then slowly stir in the nutritional yeast and cinnamon. SLOWLY, GODDAMMIT.
4 Warm a griddle over medium heat and spray a little oil on it so these  ers won’t stick. Soak your bread slices in the batter for a couple seconds on each side and then throw them right on the griddle. Cook until they look golden and tasty all over, 1 to 2 minutes a side. Serve with maple syrup, an extra dash of cinnamon, and some fresh fruit if you’re feeling Frenchy.
