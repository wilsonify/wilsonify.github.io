## ingredients

* 2 TBL orange juice* 2 TBL orange juicegar



* optional *
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

* 1 pinch salt

# instructions
1 First get going on the tortilla dough: In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and oil so that you get some pea-size clumps of oil all in that shit. Make a well in the center and pour in the water and lime juice. Mix it all together until there are no more dry spots. Still looking kinda dry? Add up to .25 cup extra water, 1 TBL at a time so you don’t fucking overdo it like you always do, until that fucker looks all moist. Shape it into a ball, cover the bowl with some plastic wrap, and stick it in the fridge while you make the compote. Fuck it, you could even do this shit the night before.
2 Now make the fruit compote while that dough chills out: Throw the berries, orange juice, brown sugar, vanilla (if using), and salt into a medium saucepan over a medium-low heat. The berries will start releasing a bunch of liquid soon, so chill the fuck out if you think it looks too dry right now. Bring that shit to a simmer and cook it until the berries start breaking down and the liquid starts to evaporate, 20 to 30 minutes depending on what berries you picked. When it looks like a cross between jam and syrup, remove from the heat and get back to those tortillas. This shit can totally be done the night before too.
3 Grab the dough from the fridge and kinda knead it around in the bowl for a couple minutes. Divide the dough up into 8 to 12 equal portions (depending on how big of a tortilla you want). On a floured surface roll those fuckers out into thin tortilla shapes. You know what you’re fucking looking for here. Warm up a skillet or a griddle over a medium-high heat and throw in the first tortilla right now. Cook it for about 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side until it starts getting kinda opaque and toasty looking. Again, you know what the fuck a cooked tortilla looks like. Cook it until it looks like that. These will keep for about 1 week in the fridge.
4 Serve them up warm, and put a big old spoon in the compote.

# modifications

Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, all that shit would be good here. If you are all about that one-berry life, don’t add anything else.
 Optional as fuck, but if you have vanilla in the house don’t skip it.
