1 So obviously you can just throw this shit all together in a bowl, with the greens on the bottom and dress it when people are ready to eat, but you should take some time with the presentation. We think the best-looking salads are when everything is all grouped together before getting mixed in because it 1. Looks healthy as fuck and 2. Is so pretty that you almost don’t want to eat it. So take the time to arrange it up right, like in the photo, and you’ll make some friends with salad. Trust.



## Modifications
Red, greenleaf, butter, romaine, whateverthefuck you like.

 Roasting beets?

 You can dress your salad with whatever the fuck you want—from our Low-Fat Farmhouse Dip made into a dressing, to our Italian Dressing, to one of the delicious bastards found here. No matter what you pick, people will be embarrassed to ask for the recipe because they can’t believe how much they love your shit
