# STUFFED MUSHROOMS



#### yields  6 TO 8 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 25 large button or cremini mushrooms 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1/2 medium yellow or white onion 
* 1/2 cup cooked millet or quinoa 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 2 green onions, finely chopped (about .25 cup) 
* 1/4 cup fresh dill or parsley 
* 1/2 tsp grated lemon zest 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/4 tsp black pepper 
* Spray oil 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 375°F. Set aside a rimmed baking sheet.

2 First, rip the stems out of the mushrooms so there’s someplace to put the filling. Set those fungi fuckers aside while you get the filling ready.

3 In a medium skillet or wok, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté it around until it starts to look a little golden, about 5 minutes. Add the millet, garlic, and green onions and cook that all together for another minute until the green onion starts looking less raw. Fold in the dill, lemon zest, salt, and pepper and remove from the heat. Taste here and add more shit if you think more garlic or herbs are what you’d like.

4 Now it’s time to stuff. Transfer the filling to a bowl and let it cool down for a few. Grab your mushrooms and fill each mushroom up, like domed up full, with a spoonful of the filling and place them on the baking sheet, filling side up, obvs. Keep going until you run out of ’shrooms. Spray the tops with a little oil and bake those fuckers up until the tops start looking nice and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.

5 Serve warm because cold, cooked whole mushrooms can be chewy as hell.



## Modifications
