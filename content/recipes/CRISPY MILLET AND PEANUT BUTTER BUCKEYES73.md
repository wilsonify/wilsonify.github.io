<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and toss in the millet. Shake the millet around in<br>the pan until it starts to smell toasted and look a little golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Set it aside.<br>2 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, mix together the peanut<br>butter, powdered sugar, flour, and vanilla until a thick dough is formed. Fold in the millet and<br>mix until that shit is all in there. Make walnut-size balls with the dough and put them on the<br>baking sheet. You should get about 24. You can lick your fingers here, we won’t snitch. Put<br>them in the freezer for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.<br>3 Right before you are about to take out the peanut butter balls, you need to melt that<br>chocolate. (For an easy technique for melting chocolate, see this page. ) When the chocolate looks all smooth, turn off the heat. This whole process should take about 3 minutes.<br>4 Gently lower a ball into the chocolate using a fork, and spoon the chocolate over the ball to<br>coat all the sides. Traditionally you are supposed to a leave the little spot of peanut butter open<br>at the top, but if you find it easier to just roll all those bitches in the chocolate, don’t fight it.<br>If you’re having trouble doing it, stir in the butter while the chocolate is still hot and it<br>will loosen that bastard up. Drip off the excess chocolate and place the buckeye down on the<br>baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the balls. Freeze them on the tray for at least 3 hours<br>before serving. Store in an airtight container and they will keep for 2 weeks in the fridge or<br>freezer. But for real, you will eat them long before then.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Olive oil, grapeseed, coconut . . . almost anything is cool here.<br> Don’t buy shit that has more than 3 ingredients, OK?
