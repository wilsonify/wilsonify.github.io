# BANANA CREAM PIE



#### yields  1 PIE, ENOUGH FOR 8 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup flour 
* 1 TBL sugar 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/4 tsp baking powder 
* 1/4 cup butter 
* 2 TBL olive or grapeseed oil 
* 2-3 TBL almond milk 
* 1/4 cup cornstarch or arrowroot powder 
* 1/4 cup sugar 
* 1 pinch salt 
* 1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk 
* 1 cup plain almond or other nondairy milk 
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 
* 3 large ripe bananas Whipped Cream 



## Instructions
1 Make the crust: Heat your oven to 350°F. Grab a standard pie plate.

2 In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Crumble the

butter into the flour using your fingers and break up pieces bigger than a pea. It should

look kinda like coarse sand from a shitty playground. You can throw this all in your food

processor too, just run it until you get the same texture, and then put it in a bowl.

3 Pour in the olive oil and 2 TBL of the almond milk and stir it all up with a fork until

a shaggy dough comes together. If it still looks dry, add the remaining TBL of milk.

Press the dough into the pie plate so that it’s even and going up the sides. You know how a pie

crust should look. (At this point, you can stick that shit in the fridge to bake later or get

right down to business. Your call.)

4 Line the inside of your crust with foil and pour a bunch of dried beans in there that you

aren’t planning on eating. This weird shit keeps the crust in place while it bakes. Trust the

system. Throw this in the oven for 12 minutes, then pull it out and remove the foil and beans.

Stick it back in the oven until the bottom looks cooked and the edges are golden, another 12

to 15 minutes. Let it cool while you make the filling.

5 Make the custard filling: In a medium saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch, sugar, and

salt. Slowly whisk in around .33 cup of the coconut milk, making sure there aren’t any clumps.

Once all the starch is dissolved, whisk in the remaining coconut milk, the almond milk, and

vanilla.

6 Put the pot over medium-high heat and keep whisking until the mixture is bubbling and you

can feel it start to thicken to sort of a gravy texture, about 5 minutes. Now, turn down the

heat to medium-low and grab a spatula. Keep the pot at a very gentle simmer and keep scraping

the bottom and sides with a spatula to avoid pudding skin. That shit is gross. Keep this up for

7 to 10 minutes or until you flick some of the custard across the top of itself in the pot and

that spot holds its shape for a couple seconds. Gross but fucking accurate.

7 Your pie crust should be cool enough to handle now. Slice up the bananas into rounds no

thicker than .5 inch. Line the crust with the banana slices, like all over the fucking place. Up

the sides, BANANAS EVERYWHERE. Now pour the warm custard into the banana-lined

pie shell. Cover and place this fucker in the fridge for at least 3 hours.

8 Once the custard has cooled and set, spread on a batch of the whipped cream over the top

and serve. This pie is best eaten within 3 days of being made because the bananas cannot be

trusted to keep their shit together much longer than that.



## Modifications
You can use whole wheat pastry, all-purpose, or a combo here. All of it will work.

 You don’t want the oil all runny and melted. It should look milky and have a consistency similar to room

temp butter. If it’s hot in your place, stick that shit in the fridge for a minute or two to cool down.
