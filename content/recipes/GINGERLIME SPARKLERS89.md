		<instructions>1 Grab your blender and throw the lime wedges, ginger, sugar, and 1 cup of the water right in.
Yeah, the whole fucking lime, rind and everything. Just have some faith. Now run that shit on
high for about 1 minute so the lime is chopped up as much as possible and that sugar gets to
break down.
2 Place a fine-mesh sieve or some cheesecloth over a pitcher and strain everything from the
blender right in. Throw away the strained pulp. Add the remaining 1 cup water and stir.
3 Now if you want to make a whole pitcher, just add the tonic water and kick back. But if
you’re making these motherfuckers by the glass, you’ll want about ¾ cup tonic water for every
.5 cup of lime mix. Done and done. And if you’re thinking of adding a shot or 2 of gin or
vodka, that shit would certainly help you relax.</instructions>
