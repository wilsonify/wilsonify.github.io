# GINGER-MUSHROOM SUMMER ROLLS
#### yields 10 TO 12 ROLLS THAT WILL HAVE PEOPLE TALKING FOR WEEKS
## ingredients
* 8 ounces mushrooms

* 3 clove garlic

* 1/2 tsp neutral-tasting oil like grapeseed

* 1 1/2 tsp soy sauce or tamari

* 1/3 cup minced green onions

* 2 TBL minced fresh ginger

* 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil

SWEET AND SOUR DIPPING SAUCE *optional*
* 1/2 cup rice vinegar

* 2 TBL sugar

* 2-3 tsp chili-garlic paste

* 1 tsp lime juice

* 1/4 cup peanuts

* 6 lettuce leaves

* 1 cucumber

* 1 carrot

* 1 cup fresh herbs

* 1 pack of large spring roll wrappers/rice paper wrappers


# instructions
1 Trim and slice the mushrooms into strips no thicker than your finger and mince the garlic.
Heat up the neutral oil in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté
until they start releasing a bunch of liquid, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the soy sauce, green onions,
ginger, and garlic and cook until most of that liquid    evaporates, about 2 more minutes.
Add the toasted sesame oil, stir to combine, and turn off the heat. Put the filling on a plate to
cool and take a second to wipe down the wok; you’ll be saving yourself clean up time later.
You’re  welcome.
2 If you are making the dipping sauce, do that    now. Throw the vinegar and sugar into a
small saucepot and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Let that cook for about 4 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Stir in the chili paste and lime juice and turn off the heat. Once it cools
for a couple minutes, pour that    into a glass and stick it in the fridge. Hold tight on those
peanuts.
3 Now let’s chop some  veggies. This recipe is pretty flexible when it comes to fillings,
so feel free to use what you’ve got. Just make sure that you have some lettuce, something
crunchy (like cucumber and carrots), and at least one herb. Almost anything tastes good in
here. Just cut everything up except the lettuce into strips about 2 inches long. Cut the lettuce
into thirds.
4 Now for the real bougie   . Warm about 3 inches of water in the same wok or skillet you
cooked the mushrooms. You want the water hot but not so hot you can’t put your hand in it.
Like tea temperature or some    like that. Turn off the heat. Place one spring roll wrapper
flat in the water for 10 to 15 seconds until it becomes bendy like a noodle. Let the extra water
drip off and lay that translucent son of a bitch down on a plate.
5 Fold the wrapper in half so that it looks like a flat taco, straight edge on the bottom. Lay
down a lettuce leaf, about 2 fingers’ worth of veggies and herbs, and a scoop of the sautéed
mushrooms on the left side of the semicircle wrapper thing you’ve got going. Fold the wrapper
over once, left to right, and then fold the bottom up like a burrito. Continue rolling kinda
tightly and press the end flap gently against the roll. If you can make a burrito then you already
have this    on lock. Keep making rolls until you run out of filling.
6 To serve, add the chopped peanuts to the dipping sauce and go to town. Finished rolls will
keep in the fridge for about 2 days but if you haven’t eaten them by then, you’re  crazy.

# modifications

Enoki, shiitake, button, whateverthe  you find is cool.
 You can find this by the soy sauce in the store.
 A combo of cilantro, mint, and basil is so  good, but use whichever of those you can find.
 They look like a stack of white paper frisbees. They are usually near the soy sauce at the store and are cheap as  .
