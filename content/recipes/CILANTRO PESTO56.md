# CILANTRO PESTO



#### yields  1 CUP


## ingredients
* 2 cup cilantro (about 1 big bunch) 
* 1/2 cup slivered or sliced almonds 
* 2 to 3 clove garlic 
* 1/2 tsp grated lemon zest 
* 1 TBL lemon juice 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water 



## Instructions
0 chop garlic

1 Throw the cilantro, almonds, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, oil, and broth in a food processor and blend until sorta smooth and, you know, pesto looking. No food processor? Just put the almonds in a bag and smash them until they are tiny and chop the rest of that    up supersmall too. Mix all of it together with a fork until it looks like a paste.
