# Corn and Basil Chowder

#### Yields: 4â€“6 servings (as a side)

## Ingredients
- 6 large ears corn, shucked  
- 1 medium onion, chopped  
- 2 ribs celery, chopped  
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped  
- 1 medium potato, chopped  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 tsp salt (plus more to taste)  
- 4 cups vegetable broth  
- 2 tbsp lemon juice (or to taste)  
- 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped  

## Instructions

1. **Prep the vegetables**  
   Cut the corn off the cobs. (It helps to snap the cob in half, stand it upright in a large bowl, and slice from top to bottom.) You should have about 4 cups of kernels. Chop the onion, celery, bell pepper, and potato into small pieces, and mince the garlic.  

2. **Start the soup base**  
   In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, bell pepper, potato, and garlic; cook for another 2 minutes. Stir in the salt and three-quarters of the corn kernels. Add the broth and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.  

3. **Blend for creaminess**  
   Turn off the heat. Use an immersion blender to blend until creamy and mostly smooth (or carefully transfer to a blender, then return to the pot).  

4. **Finish the chowder**  
   Add the remaining corn and the lemon juice, then bring back to a simmer. Remove from heat, stir in the basil, and adjust seasoning with more salt, lemon juice, or basil as needed.  

5. **Serve**  
   Ladle into bowls and garnish with extra basil for freshness.
