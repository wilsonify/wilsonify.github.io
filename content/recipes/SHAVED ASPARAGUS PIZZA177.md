# SHAVED ASPARAGUS PIZZA



#### yields  2 INDIVIDUAL PIZZAS


## ingredients
* 1 LB asparagus 
* 1 TBL lemon juice 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* 1 pinch salt 
* Olive oil, for brushing the crust 
* Toppings: arugula, chives, lemon juice, Hot sauce 



## Instructions
0 chop toppings

1 Make the pizza dough through step 4. While that yeasty beast is rising, make the garlic sauce and start the oven cranking to 475°F. Cook this on a chilly day and give your heater a fucking break.

2 Grab your asparagus and chop the bottom inch off all the spears. That shit is just too tough and you look like a fucking rabbit trying to chew a veggie for that long. Grab a single spear, hold it down on a cutting board, and use your vegetable peeler to peel off a long strip, like you are peeling a carrot. Do each side a couple of times until you are left with a kinda thin strip. Do this with all the spears. You don’t need to be perfect—you just are looking for mostly thin strips. Throw the shaved asparagus in a medium bowl and mix it up with the lemon juice, oil, and salt. It might look like way too much shit for 2 pizzas, but these fibrous bastards will shrink down once they hit the oven. Trust.

3 Roll out one ball of the dough using the deets. Spread a bunch of the roasted garlic sauce down over your pizza-shaped dough, and pile on about half the asparagus, leaving 1 inch around the edges as the crust. (Did you really need a reminder to leave space for crust on a pizza? We fucking hope not.) Repeat with the second ball of dough.

4 Brush those crusts with olive oil, put on a baking sheet, and bake until the crusts look golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Pile on some arugula, some chives, and a little more lemon juice and serve that shit up hot with some hot sauce on the side.
