* BBQ Sauce 
* 12 slider buns or 6 regular buns

# instructions

0. chop onion

1. Warm the oven to 425°F and grease a large baking sheet.

2. Make the burgers: 

Add the beans to a large bowl and mash up with a potato masher or large spoon until a sorta paste forms. 

A couple of larger bean chunks are cool. 

Add the zucchini, onion, garlic, oil, soy sauce or tamari, liquid smoke, and seasoning blend and mix until it’s all distributed.

Fold in the bread crumbs and stir that around until there are no dry patches and everything is uniform. 

This should feel slightly sticky and hold nicely when you form it into a ball. 

If it is too wet, add more bread crumbs. 

Too dry? Add some  oil. 


3. Form the mixture into 12 patties if you are making sliders or 6 patties if you are making regular burgers.

Place them on the baking sheet, spray them lightly with oil, and bake, 
flipping halfway, 
until they look a little golden brown, 
35 to 40 minutes. 

If you’re doing full-size burgers you might need to let them go 10 extra minutes.

5. While the burgers are baking, make the slaw: 

In a medium bowl, combine the cabbage, carrot, green onions, and salt. 

Get your hands in there and kinda massage the salt into the cabbage. 

This will help your slaw soften up faster so that your whole burger is on point. 

Add the vinegar, oil, and celery seed and stir until everything is coated. 

Stick it in the fridge to chill.

7. To assemble the burgers, coat the patties with BBQ sauce and smear a good amount on both sides of the buns. 

There’s no such thing as too much BBQ sauce. 

Pile a good amount of slaw right on top of that saucyass patty and you’re ready to get down. 

Serve within an hour of assembling so that your bun isn’t a sad soggy pile of mush.

# modifications

Two 15-ounce cans, drained and rinsed, are totally fine. 

Black beans would be a good sub too.

Any kind of bread crumbs you have are fine.
