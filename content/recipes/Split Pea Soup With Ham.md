## Substitutions

- Instead of split peas: Use split yellow or red lentils (cooking time may vary).
- No ham? Skip it and add smoked paprika to onions.
- Dislike bay leaves? Substitute with thyme or dill.
- Alternatively, blend in batches in a blender (carefully, not overfilling and holding a kitchen towel over the lid).
