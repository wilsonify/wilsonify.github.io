## Green Smoothies 

Green smoothies are an easy way to get more fruits and veggies into your diet. Get a dose of fiber, chlorophyll, essential vitamins, and other good stuff your body needs in one glass. Keep it simple.

- Structure for your smoothie experiments:
  - 2 cups of greens like spinach or kale (or something easier to blend if your blender isn't high-powered, like spinach)
  - 1 cup chunks of creamy fruit (frozen bananas, mangoes, or an avocado)
  - 0.75 cup of your favorite sweet frozen fruits (cherries, berries, apples, pears â€” use your imagination)
  - 1.5 cups liquid (a combo of juice, milk, water, or all water depending on sweetness preference)

- Combos to try:
  - Tropical fruits like mangoes and pineapples with coconut milk and water
  - Blueberries or blackberries with almond milk
  - All bananas with peanut butter and almond milk

Experiment and trust your taste buds!
