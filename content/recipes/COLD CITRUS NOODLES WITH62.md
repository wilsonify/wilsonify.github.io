# COLD CITRUS NOODLES WITH

#### ingredients
* 2 small carrots
* 2 small cucumbers 
* 2/3 cup thinly sliced green onions 
* 1 1/2 TBL toasted sesame seeds 



## Instructions
0 cut carrots and cucumber into matchsticks

1 Mix all the ingredients for the citrus sesame sauce together in a small glass.

2 Cook the noodles according to the package directions, because all that shit is different.

When they are done, drain and rinse them with cold water so that they stop cooking and donâ€™t

get all mushy.

3 While the noodles are cooking, cut up the veggies and green onions.

4 Add the drained noodles, carrots, cucumbers, and sesame sauce to a large bowl and toss to

combine. Fold in the green onions and sesame seeds. Serve cold or at room temp.



## Modifications
You can use udon, somen, whole wheat pasta, or whatever here, but soba (made from buckwheat) is the go-to if you can find it.
