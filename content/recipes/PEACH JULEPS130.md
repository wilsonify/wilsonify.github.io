# PEACH JULEPS

## ingredients

* 10 fresh mint leaves
* 1 tsp sugar
* ½ cup peach puree
* ¼ cup bourbon
* 1 TBL lemon or lime juice
* Ice
* 2 cup sparkling water
* Mint sprigs or sliced peaches, for garnish


## Instructions
1 Add the mint leaves and sugar to the bottom of a big pitcher or jar and mash them around with the back of a spoon to try and break down the mint a little bit. Add the peach puree, bourbon, and lemon juice and stir that shit around.

2 Pour this mixture into 4 ice-filled glasses. You can strain it if you want, your call. Add the sparkling water to each glass and garnish with some mint sprigs or peach slices if you are trying to act fancy.



## Modifications
The sugar will kinda exfoliate the mint and help release all that mint oil and other badassness we’re looking for.

 Just throw a ripe peach in a blender or food processor and run that fucker until it looks smooth. Done. Don’t try this shit with an unripe peach because it will be garbage. And if you forgot to remove the pit, congratulations. You now own a broken blender.
