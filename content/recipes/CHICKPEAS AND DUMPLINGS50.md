# CHICKPEAS AND DUMPLINGS



#### yields  6 HUNGRY MOTHER ERS


## ingredients
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 bunch of chives 
* 2 cup all-purpose flour 
* 2 tsp baking powder 
* 3/4 tsp garlic powder 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* 1 cup almond milk 
* 5 leaves kale 
* 2 sweet onions 
* 2 carrots 
* 3 ribs of celery 
* 1 small crown of broccoli 
* 3 to 4 clove garlic 
* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* Salt  ed up sizes because that’s how    is, but don’t stress. They will be fine. You should get

around 70 dumplings. Stack them up on a floured plate and stick them in the fridge uncovered.

3 Make the soup: Remove the hard stems from the kale and slice those leaves into 1-inch

ribbons. Set aside until the very end. In a large soup pot, heat up the 2 tsp oil over

medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and sauté until the onions start to brown, 5

to 7 minutes. Add the carrots and celery and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the broccoli and

garlic and cook until the carrots are getting soft but the broccoli still has some bite, another 3

minutes. Turn off the heat and dump all that    into a medium bowl and set it aside. Make

sure to scrape out all the veggies because you are reusing that pot.   extra dishes.

4 Mix the oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and .25 tsp salt together

in a small cup. Warm that soup pot back up over medium heat, add the remaining .25 cup oil,

and whisk in the flour. It should look somewhere between glue and runny paste. Yum? Keep

stirring that    around until it smells kinda nutty and looks a little toasted, about 2 minutes.

Toss in the spice mixture and keep stirring for another 30 seconds. Whisk in the white wine.

The flour will ball up with the wine and make it look like frosting or some    like that.

Slowly whisk in 2 cup of the broth. Mix that up until it is all incorporated and starts to look

thick, like movie theater nacho cheese. Slowly whisk in the next 4 cup of broth and make sure

it’s smooth with no chunks of flour. Whisk in the remaining 4 cup broth and let it simmer,

whisking every minute or so, for about 15 minutes. The broth should thicken up and start to

look and taste kind of velvety. You know what the   we are talking about. Try it. 

awesomeness without 2 sticks of butter.

5 With the pot still simmering, add the dumplings a couple at a time so they don’t get all

stuck together in a cluster  of dough and dying dreams. Once they are all in, gently stir

them around once so that everybody is bobbing around in the broth. Let them simmer

together for 3 minutes so that the pot gets a chance to warm back up. Add the chickpeas and

sautéed veggies and let them all simmer together for about 10 more minutes or until the

dumplings don’t taste raw.

6 Once your dumplings are on point, add the green peas and sliced kale. Yeah, that’s right,

just dump the peas in frozen because who gives a  ? Cook for another 2 minutes so that the

peas warm up and the kale wilts. Turn off the heat and throw in .25 cup of those chives from

earlier. Taste that    and see if you want more herbs, spices, or salt to get it where you love

it. Serve immediately and top the bowls with some of whatever chives you have left.



## Modifications
Whole wheat flour is a little too dense for these  ers, but give it a go if that’s what you got and you are feeling

brave.

 Spinach or collards will work here too.

 Whateverthe  you like to drink will work. Out of wine? Just use broth.

 About two 15-ounce cans if you aren’t cooking your own.
