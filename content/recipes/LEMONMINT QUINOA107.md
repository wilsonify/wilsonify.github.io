# LEMON-MINT QUINOA



#### yields  4 AS A SIDE


## ingredients
* 1 tsp plus 2 TBL olive oil 
* 1 1/2 cup quinoa 
* cup water 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1/2 tsp grated lemon zest 
* 2 TBL lemon juice 
* 1 1/2 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1/3 cup fresh mint 
* 2 TBL minced green onions 
* 1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted (optional)



## Instructions
1 Grab a medium saucepan with a lid and heat 1 tsp of the oil over medium heat. Add

the quinoa and sauté it around until it starts to smell a little nutty, about 2 minutes. Add the

water and salt and bring it to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat, and let that simmer until the

quinoa is tender, 15 to 18 minutes. If the quinoa is ready but there is water left at the bottom,

just drain it in your mesh strainer, return it to the pot, and cover it with a towel while you get

your other shit in order.

2 Mix together the lemon zest, lemon juice, vinegar, and remaining 2 TBL olive oil in a

small glass. After the quinoa has cooled for a couple of minutes, add the lemon dressing, mint,

and green onions to it. Toss well and fold in the almonds. Taste to see if you want more salt,

mint, or whatthefuckever. Serve at room temperature or cold.



## Modifications
Rinse it under some cool water to make sure it isn’t bitter as fuck when you cook it.

 Just use the smallest side on your box grater to grate the zest. You don’t need any fancy equipment.

 The almonds are optional but add a fucking crunch you won’t regret.
