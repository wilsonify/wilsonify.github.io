# QUINOA OATMEAL
#### yields 4
## ingredients
* 4 cup water* 4 cup water* 4 cup water* 4 cup water* 4 cup watert* 4 cup water
* 1 pinch salt

* 1/2 cup almond milk

# instructions
1 Heat up the water in a kettle on the stovetop or in the microwave until it is near boiling.
Put the quinoa in a strainer and rinse that shit so it isn’t bitter after you cook it.
2 In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the oats and stir them around until they
smell kinda toasty, about 2 minutes. Add the quinoa and the hot water and bring it all to a
boil. This won’t take long because the water should already be hot as fuck.
3 Once it is boiling, turn down the heat on the pot and let it simmer uncovered. Go check
your tumblr or Facebook shit while it cooks for 25 to 30 minutes. It should taste done now,
not hard but still a little chewy. Add the almond milk and turn off the heat.
4 Love to hit snooze? Double the recipe and heat up the leftovers all week.
