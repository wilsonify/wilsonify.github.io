# BLACKBERRY-MINT SPIKED LEMONADE

#### yields 6 cup

## ingredients
* 2 lemons into chunks lemons into chunks
* 15 large mint leaves
* 0.25 to .5 cup sugar
* 2 cup fresh or frozen blackberries
* 3/4 cup bourbon

# instructions
0 chop lemons

1 Throw the lemon chunks, mint, .25 cup sugar, blackberries, and water into the blender and let it go until everything is chopped up, about 1 minute. 
Use a fine-mesh strainer/sieve or some cheesecloth to strain out all the chunky bits when you pour it into a pitcher. 
Mix in the bourbon to taste. 
Add the rest of the sugar. 

2 Serve it up cold or over ice. OH YEAH.

# modifications

The amount of sugar you add will depend on how sweet your berries are. 
Try the lower amount first.

Optional, but please. Donâ€™t water down your punch by dumping too many ice cubes in there. 
Instead, add frozen fruit. 

A cheaper option is to freeze a couple inches of water in your Bundt pan (see House Rules) and stick the ice ring in your punch bowl.
