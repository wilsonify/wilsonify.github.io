Chemometrics is a branch of chemistry that involves the use of statistical and mathematical techniques to 
analyze and interpret chemical data. 
It is used to extract meaningful information from chemical data sets, 
such as data from spectroscopic or chromatographic analyses, 
and to identify patterns and trends in the data. 
Chemometrics is used in a wide range of applications, 
including quality control in manufacturing, environmental monitoring, 
and the development of new analytical methods.
