		<instructions>1 For the dipping sauce: Throw the vinegar and sugar into a small saucepot and bring it to a simmer over a medium heat. Let that cook for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the tomato paste, chili paste, and lime juice and remove from the heat. Once it cools for a couple minutes, pour that shit into a small glass and stick it in the fridge. Don’t throw the peanuts on there until right before you serve it otherwise they get all fucking soggy.
2 For the filling: Cook the noodles according to package directions. When they are done, drain them and run them under cold water until they are cool to the touch. Throw them in a medium bowl and toss them up with the soy sauce or tamari and sesame oil. Set aside.
3 Now you should chop up all your veggies into strips about 2 inches long.
4 It’s time to wrap this shit up. Warm about 3 inches of water in a wok or skillet over a low heat. You want the water hot but not so hot you can’t put your hand in it because that’s exactly what you’re about to do. Remove from the heat. Place one spring roll wrapper flat in the water for 10 to 15 seconds until it becomes bendy like a noodle. Let the extra water drip off and lay that translucent motherfucker down on a plate.
5 Now you’re going to treat this shit like it’s a tiny burrito. About .5 inch from the wrapper edge closest to you, lay down the cabbage, cucumber, carrot, herbs, and a forkful of the noodles. Roll that shit over once away from you, then fold the edges in toward the center so you kinda have a rectangle shape going on, and then burrito away. Continue rolling kinda tightly and press the end flap gently against the roll (like the rolls found here). Keep making rolls until you run out of filling. If you make these a few hours ahead of time, store them in the fridge with a lightly damp paper towel or clean dish towel over them so their delicate asses don’t dry out.
6 To serve, add the chopped peanuts to the top of the dipping sauce and go to town. Finished rolls will keep in the fridge for about 2 days, but if you haven’t eaten them by then, you’re fucking crazy.</instructions>
		<modifications>You can find chili garlic paste by the soy sauce in the store.
 WTF are glass noodles?
 Spring roll or rice paper wrappers look like a stack of chalk-colored, paper frisbee things. They are usually near the soy sauce at the store and are cheap as hell.
 A combo of cilantro, mint, and basil is legit, but use what you can find.</modifications>
