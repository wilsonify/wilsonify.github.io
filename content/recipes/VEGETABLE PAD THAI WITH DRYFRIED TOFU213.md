# VEGETABLE PAD THAI WITH DRY-FRIED TOFU



#### yields  4


## ingredients
* 3 TBL water 
* 3 TBL brown sugar 
* 3 TBL tomato paste 
* 3 TBL rice vinegar 
* 14 ounces rice noodles 
* 1 medium crown of broccoli 
* 1/3 cup sliced shallots 
* 4 clove garlic 
* 1 cup sliced green onions 
* 1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro 
* 2 tsp neutral-tasting oil 
* Dry-Fried Tofu 
* 2 cup thinly sliced cabbage 
* 1 carrot, thinly sliced into matchsticks 
* 1 cup bean sprouts 
* peanuts 
* Lime wedges 



## Instructions
1 Mix together all the stuff for the sauce in a medium glass.

2 Cook your noodles according to the package directions. Rinse with cold water. Chop up the

broccoli into pieces no bigger than a quarter and get all the rest of your veggies and herbs on

lock. Get ready to stir-fry.

3 Now that you’ve got everything lined up, heat the oil over medium heat in a big skillet or

wok. When the pan is hot, add the shallots and stir-fry those fuckers until they start to char

around the edges, about 2 minutes. Add the broccoli and keep that shit up for another 2

minutes until the broccoli is kinda charred but isn’t limp as fuck. Now add the garlic and fry it

up for another 30 seconds. Gently add the noodles and .33 cup of the sauce and toss that shit

all around to make sure everything is covered. Keep stirring and fold in the tofu. Cook for

another 30 seconds to a minute to make sure the sauce is nice and absorbed. Keep adding more

TBL of sauce until it is exactly how you like it. Turn off the heat and fold in the green

onions and cilantro.

4 Serve this mound of deliciousness right away piled high on a plate next to the cabbages,

carrots, bean sprouts, and topped with the peanuts. Have some limes wedges shoved in there

and squeeze that shit over it before you dig in.



## Modifications
Don’t eat this all at once because that is too much goddamn salt for one day. Fuck.

 Use a yellow onion if that is what you can find.

 Like safflower or grapeseed

 Red, green, whatthefuckever
