* 12 ounces firm silken tofu, drained 
* 1/4 cup sliced almonds 
* 3 TBL nutritional yeast 
* 2 TBL lemon juice 
* 3 clove garlic, 2 whole and 1 minced 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 0.5 yellow onion 
* 4 cup spinach 
* Squeeze of lemon juice 
* 1 pinch salt 
* 1/4 cup fresh basil 
* 1 LB pasta, cooked 
* 3 cup Quick Blender Marinara or Blender Red Sauce 
* 3 TBL bread crumbs 
* 1 TBL nutritional yeast 
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder 
* 1 TBL olive oil 



## Instructions
0 chop onion

1 Warm up your oven to 350°F. Have an 8 x 10-inch baking dish handy.

2 In a blender or food processor, combine the artichoke hearts, tofu, almonds, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, whole clove of garlic, and salt and run until there aren’t any big chunks. (You have a shitty blender that was just never the same after that one party? Just add a TBL of water to help get that shit going as you bang on the side. #beenthere)

3 In a medium skillet, heat the oil up over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it starts to look kinda see-thru, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach, minced garlic, lemon juice, and salt and sauté until the spinach has wilted and given up that leaf life, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.

4 In a big bowl, mix together the tofu-artichoke mixture, spinach-onion mixture, basil, and cooked pasta until there aren’t any big globs in there.

5 Grab the baking dish and cover the bottom with 1 cup of the marinara. Pour in the pasta mixture in an even layer, then pour the rest of the marinara over the top and kinda smear it around with the back of a spoon so that all the pasta gets coated.

6 Make the topping: In a small bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, nutritional yeast, and garlic powder. In a small skillet, heat up the oil over medium heat. Add the bread crumb mixture and sauté until everything is coated in oil and it smells kinda toasty, about 3 minutes.

7 Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the top of the pasta, cover it with foil, and stick it in the oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, take off the foil, and bake it uncovered for 10 minutes longer. Let that shit cool for a couple of minutes before serving.
