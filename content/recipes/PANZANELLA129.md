# PANZANELLA



#### yields  4 TO 6 PEOPLE NO PROBLEM, OR ONE LEGIT BOWL FOR A PICNIC


## ingredients
* 2 TBL lemon juice 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 1/2 loaf stale crusty bread, cut into bite-size cubes (about 6 cup) 
* 1 cup cooked quinoa 
* 1/2 small red onion, sliced 
* 2 cup halved cherry or grape tomatoes 
* 1 1/2 cup bite-size pieces of cucumber 
* 1 red bell pepper 
* 1/2 cup packed sliced fresh basil 
* 1 cup fresh parsley 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* Black pepper 



## Instructions
0 chop bell peppers and parsley

1 Make the dressing: In a small glass, mix together the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and oil until it looks all fucking nice and uniform. Set it aside.

2 Make the salad: In a big bowl, mix together the bread, quinoa, onion, tomatoes, cucumber, and bell pepper. Pour the dressing over the whole salad and mix that shit around. Add the basil, parsley, salt, and pepper to taste and keep mixing until everything is coated. Taste and add more of whateverthefuck you think it needs.

3 Serve right away or let that fucker chill in the fridge for a while. Best served the day it’s made ’cause those croutons have a shelf life once they start disintegrating in all the delicious dressing.



## Modifications
You could use French bread or whatever you got. Sourdough would be our weapon of choice though.

 Reference that shit.
