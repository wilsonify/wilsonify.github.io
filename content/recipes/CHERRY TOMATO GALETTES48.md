# CHERRY TOMATO GALETTES



#### yields  2 GALETTES, ENOUGH FOR 4 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 yellow onion, sliced 
* 3 cup halved cherry tomatoes 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 1 TBL balsamic vinegar 
* 2 TBL fresh basil, plus more for garnish 
* Olive oil, for brushing the crusts 



## Instructions
1 Make the pie crust through step 2. Let it chill out in the fridge while you make the filling. Also, crank your oven to 425°F.

2 Make the filling: Grab a large skillet or wok and heat up the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté them around until those  ers start to look a little golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Throw in the tomatoes and salt and keep sautéing until the tomatoes start breaking down a little bit, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and balsamic and cook for a minute or two more, until most of the vinegar has evaporated. Once that    is done, remove from the heat and stir in the basil. Taste and see if you need more salt or garlic. You know how you like   .

3 To assemble the tart, roll out one of the crusts on a well-floured surface like your counter or a table until it’s about .25 inch thick. You want it kinda round, but that    shouldn't be perfect; we’re going for homemade as hell. Pile half the filling into the center of the crust leaving a 2-inch border around the edge. Fold the 2-inch border up and over the filling, brush the dough with some olive oil, and transfer it to a baking sheet. Do the same    again with the other crust.

4 Bake until the crusts are looking nice and golden, 25 to 35 minutes. They should smell  amazing, but you need to wait a few minutes before you cut them up because those tiny-ass tomatoes are straight-up lava temperatures. Serve warm with some extra basil sprinkled over to really class that    up.
