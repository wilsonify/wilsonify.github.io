# instructions
0 chop onion and serranos
1 Throw all that in a food processor or blender and blend it until it’s how you like it. Chunky,
smooth . . . your salsa = your rules. Taste and add more lime juice if you think it needs it. Serve
chilled or at room temperature. Keeps for about 4 to 5 days in the fridge, but your willpower
probably won’t allow for any leftovers.

# modifications

You can remove the seeds if you aren’t down with a hot salsa.
 Yeah, that’s basically a whole bulb. Roasted garlic is broken down in “How to Roast Garlic ”, but you can use 2
or 3 clove of raw garlic if you are having a salsa emergency.
