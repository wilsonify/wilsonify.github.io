# BLENDED EARL GREY LATTES


     

     






#### yields  2 TALL DRINKS


## ingredients
* 2 cup vanilla almond milk 
* 1/2 cup water 
* 4 bags Earl Grey tea 
* 1-2 tsp maple syrup or agave syrup 
* 2 cup ice cubes 
* 0.5 banana, cut into chunks and frozen 



## Instructions
1 In a small saucepan, heat the almond milk and water over medium heat until it starts to

bubble around the edges. Turn off the heat and add the tea bags. Let them steep for 10

minutes while you do something incredibly unproductive. If you let the tea steep too long it

could taste bitter, so set a fucking timer. Take the bags out and stick all that in the fridge to

cool down for at least 1.5 hours.

2 When you’re ready to drink, add the maple syrup, ice, banana, and tea mix to a blender and

run until it is smooth.



## Modifications
Honestly you can use chai, yerba maté, peppermint, whateverthefuck tea you like to drink. Go crazy.

 This sweetens it up and helps it get creamy. It’s a good idea to keep a bag of peeled, frozen banana chunks in the

freezer for moments like this.
