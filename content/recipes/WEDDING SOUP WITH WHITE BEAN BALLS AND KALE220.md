<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>0 chop carrots and celery<br>1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.<br>2 Now, make the bean balls. Chop up the onion and measure out .25 cup. Save the rest but<br>push it to the side; we’ll use that shit in a bit. Mash up the beans in a large bowl until they<br>form a paste. Some whole bean bits are cool, but try to keep that shit to a minimum. Stir in<br>the rest of the ingredients including the .25 cup chopped onion and mix it all up so that<br>everything gets distributed. You might need to use your hands to really get in there. Don’t act<br>like you’re too cool to touch bean paste. If it feels a little dry, add a TBL or two of water.<br>Roll the dough into balls about the size of a golf ball and put them on the greased up baking<br>sheet. You should get 20 to 25 depending on your rollin’ skills. Spray them with a little<br>cooking spray and bake them for about 30 minutes, turning them over halfway, until both sides<br>are golden brown.<br>3 While the balls are cooking, get your soup ready. In a large soup pot, heat the oil over<br>medium heat. Add the rest of that onion from earlier (told ya), the carrots, and celery and<br>sauté until the onion starts to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and pasta and cook for<br>30 more seconds. Gently pour in the broth and let it all simmer together until the pasta is<br>tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Fold in the lemon juice, greens, salt, pepper, and parsley and turn off<br>the heat.<br>4 When everything is ready, place 3 or 4 bean balls in the bottom of a bowl and gently ladle the<br>soup over them. Serve it up right away. The balls will slowly break apart as you eat and<br>everything will taste so damn good together you’ll understand why the fuck it’s called wedding<br>soup.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Or two 15-ounce cans.
