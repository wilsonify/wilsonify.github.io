# SPICED CHICKPEA WRAPS WITH TAHINI DRESSING

#### yields  4 BIG WRAPS

## ingredients
* 3 TBL warm water
* 1 ½ TBL lemon juice
* 1 TBL rice vinegar
* 1 TBL olive oil
* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari
* 2 clove garlic
* 1 TBL olive oil
* 3 cup cooked chickpeas
* 2 TBL lemon juice
* 1 tsp maple syrup
* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* ¼-½ tsp cayenne pepper
* 4 large tortillas
* Spinach
* Cucumber sticks
* Carrot sticks


# instructions
1 To make the dressing, mix all that shit together in a small glass until it is smooth and
creamy. Set it in the fridge.
2 Now get the chickpeas going. Heat up the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-
high heat. Add the chickpeas and fry them until they start to turn gold and pop around a bit.
You’ll see what the fuck we mean. This will take 3 to 5 minutes. In a small glass, mix together
the lemon juice, maple syrup, and soy sauce. When the chickpeas are lookin’ right, pour the
lemon juice mixture over them and stir. Let that shit evaporate for about 30 seconds and then
add all the spices. Stir and let them all fry together for another 30 seconds and then turn off
the heat.
3 Serve these spiced sons of bitches in a wrap with some spinach leaves and thinly sliced carrot
and cucumber sticks. Drizzle some dressing over it and wrap that shit up.

# modifications

This is like peanut butter but made out of sesame seeds. It will be near the nut butters or falafel mix at the store.
 Two 15-ounce cans if you aren’t simmering that shit yourself
