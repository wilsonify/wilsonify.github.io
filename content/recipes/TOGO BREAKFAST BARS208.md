# TO-GO BREAKFAST BARS
#### yields 10 BARS
## ingredients
* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oatse* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oatsd* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oats* 2 cup rolled oats or almond butter

* 1/4 cup olive oil* 1/4 cup olive oil * 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 tsp vanilla extract


# instructions
1 Heat your oven to 350°F. Grab a 9 x 13-inch baking dish and line it with parchment so
some of the paper goes over the edge of the pan. This yieldsit way fucking easier to just lift
the bars out of the pan after they cool. Planning ahead like a fucking grownup.
2 Heat a large skillet or wok over a medium-low heat and add the oats, quinoa, and millet. Stir
them all around until they start to smell toasted, about 3 minutes. While that shit is
happening, combine the nuts and cranberries in a large bowl. Pour in the toasted oat mix and
the salt and mix that shit together.
3 In a small saucepan, combine the maple syrup, peanut butter, oil, sugar, and vanilla and warm
until everything is melted. Make sure that the peanut butter is all mixed and then remove from
the heat. Pour this all over the dry mix and stir until everything is fucking coated.
4 Pour the mixture into the baking dish and press it down with a spoon to even it out and
make sure it is really fucking in there. Throw it in the oven until it all looks toasted, 25 to 30
minutes. Let it cool to room temperature in the pan then throw it into the fridge. When it’s
all nice and cold, cut into bars. They keep best in the fridge.

# modifications

We like .5 cup pumpkin seeds, .5 cup sunflower seeds, and .5 cup sliced almonds but mix it up how you like.
