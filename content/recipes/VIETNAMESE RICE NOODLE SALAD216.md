# VIETNAMESE RICE NOODLE SALAD



#### yields  4 AS MAIN, 6 AS A SIDE


## ingredients
* 6 3/4 oz maifun or thin rice noodles 
* 0.5 head lettuce 
* 2 medium carrots 
* 1 cucumber 
* 1 cup mint leaves 
* 1 cup basil leaves 
* 1 cup cilantro 
* 1 cup green onions 
* Toasted Sesame Dressing, with 1 clove minced garlic added for an extra special something 
* 1/2 cup salted, roasted peanuts, finely chopped 
* Lime wedges, for serving 



## Instructions
0 chop lettuce, cilantro, green onion; cut carrots, cucumber into matchsticks; slice mint and basil

1 Cook the noodles according to package directions. When they are done, drain the noodles

and run them under cold water until they are cool to the touch. Set aside.

2 While all that is going down, you should get all your veggies and herbs ready and make your

dressing.

3 To serve, pile a large mound of noodles in the center of each plate. Arrange the lettuce,

veggies, and herbs around the mound while leaving a good amount of the noodles exposed.

Drizzle the dressing on both the noodles and lightly around the vegetables and herbs, then

sprinkle the peanuts all over that delicious bitch. Serve with lime wedges.



## Modifications
Red leaf, butter, whatever. Just a soft, leafy lettuce. Donâ€™t overthink it.
