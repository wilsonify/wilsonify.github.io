# BLUEBERRY SAUCE
#### yields
1 CUP
## ingredients
* 2 TBL sugar* 2 TBL sugari* 2 TBL sugar* 2 TBL sugar* 2 TBL sugarextract

* 2 large pieces lemon zest

# instructions
1 Throw everything together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. It may not look like
enough liquid, but once the berries start breaking down you’ll see what the fuck is up. Stir it
around, smashing some berries with your spoon as you go. Bring the pot to a simmer and let it
go for about 10 minutes so the berries really break down and the sauce thickens a bit. Take out
the lemon zest, pour the sauce into a glass or bowl, and let that shit cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
It will get thicker as it cools.

# modifications

Take your knife or sharp vegetable peeler and run it down the side of a lemon to cut off 2 pieces of the zest (the
colored outer layer) about the length of a finger. Try not to get a bunch of that white shit, but don’t worry too
much about it.
