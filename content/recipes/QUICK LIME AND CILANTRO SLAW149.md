# QUICK LIME AND CILANTRO SLAW



## ingredients
* 0.5 LB of green cabbage 
* 1 small carrot 
* 2 TBL lime juice 
* 2 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1 tsp olive oil 
* 1/8 tsp salt 
* 1/3 cup cilantro 



## Instructions
1 Cut the cabbage into the thinnest strips you can and make sure those pieces are no longer than

2 inches. This is a great time to get good with your knife if you are looking for a silver 

lining in all that chopping. Chop the carrot into thin matchsticks of the same length. Got

that    down now, right? In a small glass, mix together the lime juice, vinegar, oil, and salt.

Add the dressing right before you are going to eat and toss that    well. Add the cilantro

and serve.
