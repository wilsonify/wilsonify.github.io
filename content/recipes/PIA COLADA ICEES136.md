# PIÑA COLADA ICEES



#### yields  5 cup, ENOUGH FOR 2 TO 4 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 2 cup ice cubes 
* 1 1/2 cup frozen pineapple chunks 
* 1 1/2 cup pineapple juice 
* 3/4 cup white rum 
* 1/2 cup canned coconut milk 
* 2 bananas, broken into chunks and frozen 
* 2 TBL agave syrup or your favorite liquid sweetener 



## Instructions
Throw everything in a blender that can  handle some ice and let that    run until your drink as is smooth as you imagine yourself being after you drink it.



## Modifications
Or, you know, whatever amount of rum you want based on how   ty your day was. No judgment here. Not drinking? Substitute water or coconut water for a chill treat without the kick.

 You can totally leave agave out if you don’t like your drinks sweet. But we say  go for it. You’ve earned it.
