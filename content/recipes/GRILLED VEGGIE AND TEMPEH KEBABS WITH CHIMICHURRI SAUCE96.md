<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>0 chop garlic<br>1 Make the chimichurri sauce: Throw all the sauce ingredients together in a food processor or blender and let that fucker run until it looks kinda like a chunky pesto. If it’s getting a little stuck, add a TBL of water to get that shit going again.<br>2 For the kebabs: Place a steamer insert and a couple inches of water in a small pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the tempeh, cover, and steam until it starts to smell kinda nutty, about 10 minutes.<br>3 While the tempeh is steaming, mix the broth, soy sauce or tamari, liquid smoke, and oil together is a medium bowl.<br>4 When the tempeh is done, dump it in the bowl with the marinade and mix it together so every piece gets some of that flavor on it. Let it sit, stirring occasionally, while you chop the veggies.<br>5 Cut the zucchini, onion, and bell pepper into large chunks about the size of the tempeh cubes. Stick them and the tempeh on the skewers alternating ingredients until you fill them all up. You know what the fuck to do; you’ve seen a fucking kebab before. (Don’t throw the tempeh marinade out.)<br>6 Bring your grill to a medium-high heat.<br>7 In a small bowl, mix together 2 TBL of that tempeh marinade, the no-salt seasoning, and the paprika. Using a pastry brush or spoon, spread that shit all over the kebabs. That’s right, we’re layering the flavors, bitches. Place the kebabs on the grill and cook for 7 to 9 minutes, turning every couple minutes. You are looking for those bomb-ass grill marks and for the veggies to get golden brown around the edges. If they start looking a little dry before they are done, brush them with a little bit of olive oil or some of the remaining marinade. Take them off the grill and let them cool for a hot minute.<br>8 To serve you can either pour the chimichurri sauce over the kebabs or serve it on the side so people can dip how they want. Up to you. Or forget other people and just make these for yourself. B.Y.O.K.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>WTF?<br> Paprika is just so it looks extra sexy. Leave it out if you don’t already have that shit in your pantry.<br>If you’re using bamboo or wooden skewers, soak those motherfuckers in some water for at least 10 minutes before you start grilling. This will keep the ends from burning up as soon as you set them on the grill. That shit is amateur.</p></div></div>
