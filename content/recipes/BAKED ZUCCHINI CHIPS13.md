# BAKED ZUCCHINI CHIPS



#### yields  4 TO 6, ABOUT 30 CHIPS, DEPENDING ON THE


## ingredients
* 1 medium zucchini, about 4 inches long and 1.5 inches wide 
* 1 TBL flour 
* 1/4 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder 
* 1 pinch salt 



## Instructions
1 Heat your oven to 350Â°F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.

2 Cut the zucchini into coins a little thicker than a quarter. If you cut them too thin they will

burn the fuck up in the oven. If your slices start releasing some liquid, dab them with a towel

to dry them off. Mix together the flour, paprika, garlic powder, and salt in a medium bowl.

Toss in the zucchini and mix them together until all the zucchini pieces are coated in flavor.

3 Lay the zucchini on the baking sheet and coat the slices lightly with cooking spray. Bake for

30 to 40 minutes, flipping them over every 10 minutes, until they are all golden and crisp. Keep

your eye on them because they can go from perfectly crispy to burnt to shit in a hot second.

They are best served the day they are made so that crunch stays intact.



## Modifications
Whole wheat, white, rice, whatever you got is fine.
