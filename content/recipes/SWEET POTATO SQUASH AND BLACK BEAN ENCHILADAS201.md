# SWEET POTATO, SQUASH, AND BLACK BEAN ENCHILADAS
#### yields  8 ENCHILADAS

## ingredients

* 2 ¼ cup vegetable broth
* 1/3 cup tomato paste
* 2 ½ TBL chili powder
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 1 ½ tsp dried oregano
* 2 to 3 clove garlic
* 2 tsp soy sauce or tamari
* 1 TBL lime juice
* 1 large sweet potato
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 0.5 yellow onion
* 1 medium yellow squash
* 1 tsp chili powder
* ½ tsp ground cumin
* ½ tsp salt
* 2 clove garlic
* 1 ½ cup cooked black beans
* 1 tsp maple syrup or agave syrup
* 1 pack tortillas
* Sliced avocado
* fresh cilantro

# instructions
0 chop onion and potato into nickel-size pieces; grate squash (about 1 cup)
1 Make the enchilada sauce: Dump everything but the lime juice into a medium saucepan and
bring to a simmer. Use a whisk or something and make sure that the tomato paste isn’t just
sitting in a fucking clump. Let that simmer together for 10 to 15 minutes so that the sauce
has time to thicken up a little. Add the lime juice and turn off the heat. Let that shit cool while
you make the filling.
2 To cook the sweet potato, grab a medium saucepan, fill it with an inch or two of water, and
bring to a boil over medium heat. Throw in your metal steamer basket and fill that with the
chopped sweet potato. Cover and steam until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Dump into a bowl and
smash the pieces around. Some chunks are fine, so you don’t need to work too hard at making
this smooth.
3 While the sweet potato steams, grab a large skillet or wok and heat the oil over medium
heat. Add the onion and sauté until it begins to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Toss in the squash
and cook for another minute. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, garlic, and black beans. Cook
together for another 2 minutes and then fold in the mashed sweet potato and maple syrup and
turn off the heat. Mix until all that shit is combined.
4 Now you’re going to make the motherfucking enchiladas. Crank your oven to 375°F. Grab a
9 x 13-inch baking dish.
5 Cover the bottom of the baking dish with about 1.5 cup of enchilada sauce. Using a griddle,
your oven, or the microwave, warm up the tortillas. Dip a tortilla around in a little of the sauce
in the baking dish so that the bottom is all coated. Fill the tortilla with a couple spoonfuls of
filling, then roll it up and set it seam-side down in the dish. You know how the fuck enchiladas
are supposed to look, so handle that shit. Keep going until you run out of space or out of
filling.
6 Cover the enchiladas with the remaining sauce, cover the dish tightly with foil, and throw it
in the oven for 20 minutes. Take off the foil and cook it for 5 more minutes. Let it cool for a
minute or two before serving. Feel free to top those savory sons of bitches with some sliced
avocado or chopped cilantro if you give a shit about presentation.

# modifications

You really just need 1 large cooked sweet potato. If you have a leftover roasted sweet potato or something, just
scoop out the flesh and move on with the recipe. Or steam it in the microwave if that is your shit: Stab it with a
fork, then cook on high for 5 minutes, flip, then 5 minutes more.
 Or one 15-ounce can
