# Baked Spring Rolls

#### Yields 12 Rolls (Depending On The Size Of The Wrappers You Grab)

## Ingredients
- 2 tsp neutral oil, such as grapeseed
- 1 cup sliced shiitake or button mushrooms
- 1 carrot, cut into thin matchsticks
- 1 large rib celery, cut into thin matchsticks
- 1 head of napa or green cabbage, cut into bite-size strips (about 4.5 cups)
- 1/4 cup minced green onions
- 1 cup cooked glass noodles
- 1 1/2 TBL soy sauce or tamari
- 1 TBL rice vinegar
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 12 large spring roll wrappers
- Spray oil
- Dipping Sauce (Optional)
  - 1 TBL soy sauce or tamari
  - 1 TBL rice vinegar
  - 1 TBL water
  - 1 tsp Asian-style hot sauce
  - 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
  - 1 tsp agave syrup
  - 1 clove garlic

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F. Grab a large rimmed baking sheet.

2. In a large wok or skillet, warm up the oil over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms, carrot, and celery until mushrooms release some liquid (about 2 minutes). Add cabbage and green onions, cook until cabbage reduces (about 3 minutes). Add noodles, soy sauce or tamari, vinegar, and pepper. Mix well and remove from heat.

3. To make spring rolls, lay out a wrapper with one corner pointed toward you. Keep the remaining wrappers covered with a moist cloth. Follow the steps in the image guide provided in the recipe.

4. Continue making rolls until you run out of filling or wrappers, aiming for at least 12. If worried about filling quantity, do a little less.

5. Place the spring rolls on the baking sheet, seam-side down. Bake, turning halfway, until both sides are golden and crispy (30 to 35 minutes).

6. Mix the optional dipping sauce while the rolls bake by combining soy sauce or tamari, rice vinegar, water, hot sauce, sesame oil, agave, and garlic in a small bowl.

7. Let the rolls cool for a couple of minutes, then serve with dipping sauce.
