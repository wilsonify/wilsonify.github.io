# instructions
0 chop onion, carrots, bell pepper.
1 Stir-fry the vegetables: In a large wok or skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the carrots, bell pepper, and onion and stir-fry those crunchy sons of bitches around until the onion starts to look sorta translucent and the veggies are softening up, like 3 to 4 minutes. Throw in the spinach and green peas and keep cooking until the spinach starts to wilt, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and scrape all that    onto a plate so you can reuse that pan. Yeah, we hate getting a bunch of pans dirty because dishes are the worst.
2 Now for the scrambled tofu: In the same pan, heat up the oil over medium heat. While that is heating up, drain the tofu and squeeze out as much water as possible. You can squeeze this    with your hands, no need to press this because again:   extra dishes. Now crumble the tofu into the pan in chunks about the size of a quarter. Some small bits are cool, but the more you stir it, the more    is gonna break down, so start bigger and let it get smaller on its own. Stir the tofu around until it starts to brown a little, 2 to 3 minutes.
3 Add the soy sauce or tamari, curry powder, and garlic and keep cooking that    until the tofu is all nice and coated and looking less wet and gushy. You know what the   we mean. That should take 2 to 3 minutes longer. Then add the nutritional yeast, stir to coat, and remove from the heat. Scrape that    out onto a plate because that pan has one last job.
4 Make the fried rice: Heat the wok back up over medium heat and add the oil. Throw in the rice and stir-fry until it begins to warm, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the soy sauce or tamari over the rice, mix well, and then add the cooked vegetables from earlier. Stir-fry for a minute so everything is well mixed. Fold in the scrambled tofu. Pour the sesame oil and lime juice over the pan, stir one more time, and remove from the heat.
5 Top with the green onions and enjoy the   out of your savory brunch.

# modifications

You could use kale or whatever your go-to green is. No need to buy a bunch of different   .
 Frozen peas are legit here. Don’t overthink this.
 Do yourself a favor and don’t buy any curry powder with salt as an ingredient. You don’t need them sneaking extra sodium on you like that.
 WTF?
DON’T EVEN  THINK about using freshly cooked rice here because it will get all mushy and taste like a disaster. The trick to good fried rice is using cold, leftover cooked rice because it’s drier and the rice kernels are separated. This keeps it from being a sticky gross paste, SO PLAN AHEAD.
