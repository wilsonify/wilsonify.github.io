# instructions
0 chop bell pepper
1 In a large skillet or wok, heat up the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it starts to get browned in some spots, 5 to 7 minutes depending on your drafty-ass kitchen. Add the sweet potato, squash, and bell pepper and sauté until the sweet potato starts to soften up, about 5 minutes. Throw in the spinach, garlic, Bragg’s, paprika, chili powder, and black pepper and keep on cooking that    until the spinach wilts down, about 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and hot sauce, then remove from the damn heat. Taste and add more of whateverthe  you think it’s missing. Let that cool while you make the grits or even make this    the night before and sleep in the extra 30 minutes. You know you want to. (See House Rules.)
2 Make the grits just like we say to. When they are all cooked through, remove from the heat and stir in the sweet potato mixture, the milk, and the extra .25 cup nutritional yeast (the grits already have nutritional yeast in them—this is extra).
3 Warm up your oven to 350°F. Grease up a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.
4 Pour that whole mess into the baking dish and bake until the edges look golden and  delicious, about 30 minutes. Let it cool for a couple minutes before serving.
5 Serve warm with extra hot sauce on the side.

This takes about 1 medium sweet potato and is a  workout on your arm. If someone in your place owes you a favor, call it in for this    or borrow their food processor with that fancy grating attachment thing.
 WTF?
Get a head start and cook this    the night before. To reheat it, just cover it in foil and throw it back in the oven at 350°F for 15 to 20 minutes to get warm. Take a longer shower instead because you earned that    for being so damn clever.
