# BUFFALO LETTUCE BITES


## ingredients
* 3 cup cooked chickpeas
* butter, or green leaf lettuce, something that can hold a scoop 
* Buffalo Sauce, for serving 



## Instructions
0 chop celery

1 Dump the chickpeas in a food processor and run that    until they’re nice and chopped up. Don’t have a processor or don’t want to get it dirty? Just throw those beany bastards into a bowl and mash them up with a potato masher or fork. Either way, you don’t want any large chunks, but you got some texture; think rice-size chunks for most of it. Dump the mashed chickpeas into a big bowl (if you didn’t mash them in one to begin with). Throw in the celery, carrot, red onion, garlic, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper and stir that    up. Taste and adjust the seasoning how you like. Filling done.

2 To serve, just scoop up some filling into the lettuce leaves. Either spoon some Buffalo sauce over them or set the sauce to the side so your weak-ass friends can control how much heat they eat.



## Modifications
Two 15-ounce cans, drained and rinsed, are legit too.
