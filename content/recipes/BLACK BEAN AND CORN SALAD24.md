# BLACK BEAN AND CORN SALAD
#### yields 4 PEOPLE, OR A BADASS SIDE AT A GRILL-OUT
## ingredients
* 2 medium red or orange bell peppers
0.5 red onion
* 2 tsp olive oil* 2 tsp olive oil* 2 tsp olive oil* 2 tsp olive oil* 2 tsp olive oil * 2 tsp olive oil* 2 tsp olive oil
* 3 cup cooked black beans* 3 cup cooked black beansnels



* optional *
* 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced jalapeño, seeded and minced

* 1/3 cup cilantro* 1/3 cup cilantroce


# instructions
0 chop cilantro
1 Chop the bell peppers and onion up until they are about the size of beans. Yeah, you read that    right: bean-size. Grab a medium skillet or wok and heat up the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes to soften up. Add the bell peppers and cook for a minute more. We’re just trying to take the rawness off those  ers and make them a little sweeter. Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, and salt and cook for an additional 30 seconds, then remove from the heat.
2 Dump the cooked onion/pepper mixture into a large bowl and add the black beans and corn. (If you’re using frozen corn you can just pour those bastards in cold to speed up the chilling process.) Add the jalapeño (if using), cilantro, and lime juice and stir that    up until it is all mixed. Let it chill on the counter or in the fridge for 30 minutes and then taste. Add more salt, lime juice, or garlic to get it where you’re satisfied with your salad.
3 Serve chilled or at room temperature as a salad or a dip.

# modifications

Two 15-ounces cans of beans are cool. Just drain and rinse that   .
 Fresh corn kernels cut right off the cob are legit, but you can use whatever you want. Leftover boiled corn, grilled corn, or frozen all work and are all  awesome. Do what’s easiest for you, depending on the time of year you’re whipping this up.
