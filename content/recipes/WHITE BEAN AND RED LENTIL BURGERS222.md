# WHITE BEAN AND RED LENTIL BURGERS



#### yields  8 LARGE BURGER PATTIES


## ingredients
* 1/3 cup red lentils 
* 2/3 cup water 
* 3 cup cooked white beans 
* 0.5 red onion 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 1 jalapeño, minced 
* 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 
* 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1 1/2 tsp seasoning blend 
* 1 tsp ground cumin 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* Grated zest of .5 lime 
* Cooking spray 
* Burger fixings, like buns, lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. 



## Instructions
0 chop onion

1 Combine the lentils and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat

and let that all simmer until the lentils are soft and mushy and the water is mostly gone, about

10 minutes. Drain away any extra water and let the lentils cool while you prep all the other

  .

2 Mash the white beans in a large bowl and then add the lentils and the rest of the ingredients

(not counting the cooking spray and fixings). If you find the mixture too wet to hold its

shape, add some more breadcrumbs. Shape that mix into patties (you know, burger size) and

put them on an oiled baking sheet. Chill that in the fridge, covered, for at least 30 minutes or

up to 4 hours.

3 Crank your oven to 400°F when you’re ready to go. Coat the patties lightly with some

cooking spray and bake them for about 30 minutes, flipping them over halfway. You want them

to be golden on both sides. Serve them up with whatever the   you like on a burger and then

go to town.
