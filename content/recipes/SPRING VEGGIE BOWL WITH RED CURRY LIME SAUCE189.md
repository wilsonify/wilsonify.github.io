</div><div class="ing"><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul class="ing"><li clash3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Cook the noodles according to the package directions. When theyâ€™re all done, drain them,<br>run them under cool water for a sec, and then set them aside. We will need these fuckers later.<br>2 Next, make the Red Curry Lime Sauce.<br>3 Brush the baby bok choy with 1 TBL of the oil and toss the asparagus with the other<br>1 TBL. Now heat up your grill or grill pan to medium-high and lightly grease it up with<br>a thin layer of oil. Throw on the asparagus and grill those pointy fuckers until all the sides have<br>some grill marks and the stalk has a little give when you pick it up with your tongs, 5 to 8<br>minutes with periodic rotation. Next, add the bok choy and cook on each side for 3 to 4<br>minutes so that they pick up some nice grill marks. When the veggies are done, squeeze the<br>lime juice over them and add a sprinkle of salt. When the bok choy is cool enough to handle,<br>cut each piece in half one more time from top to bottom so that shit is easier to eat. Cut the<br>asparagus into 1-inch pieces for the same fucking reason.<br>4 Now throw together your bowls. Start by placing a handful of the noodles (about 1 cup) on<br>one side of the bottom of your bowl. On the other two-thirds of the bowl, pile in a bunch of<br>the grilled veggies and tofu strips. Drizzle the whole fucking thing with the sauce, top with the<br>green onions, and serve right away.</p></div></div></div>
