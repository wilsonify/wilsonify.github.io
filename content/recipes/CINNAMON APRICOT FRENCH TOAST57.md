Maple syrup, cinnamon, and fresh fruit, for serving

# instructions
1 Make the batter: Grab a small saucepan and dump in the milk and apricots. Let that shit simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes and then let it cool for another 5.
2 Pour the cooled milk/apricot mixture into a blender with the orange zest (if using) and ground flaxseeds. Blend that bitch up until it looks mostly smooth.
3 Pour the batter from the blender into a pie pan or similar-size shallow dish and then slowly stir in the nutritional yeast and cinnamon. SLOWLY, GODDAMMIT.
4 Warm a griddle over medium heat and spray a little oil on it so these fuckers won’t stick. Soak your bread slices in the batter for a couple seconds on each side and then throw them right on the griddle. Cook until they look golden and tasty all over, 1 to 2 minutes a side. Serve with maple syrup, an extra dash of cinnamon, and some fresh fruit if you’re feeling Frenchy.

# modifications

We use almond, because, well, fuck all the other milks.
 About 11 quarter-size apricot halves if you really stuff those bastards in there.
 No clue how to zest?
 WTF?
