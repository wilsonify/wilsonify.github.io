# instructions
1 Warm the oven to 250°F. Pull out 2 rimmed baking sheets and set that shit aside.
2 Grab a big-ass bowl and dump in the cereal, pretzels, and nuts.
3 Make the seasoning mix: In a small glass, mix together the paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne (if using), and black pepper. Whisk in the soy sauce and sherry vinegar so you get a kind of paste. Slowly whisk in the olive oil.
4 Pour the seasoning mix all over the big bowl of cereal and keep mixing until everything looks coated. Pour it out into a single layer on the baking sheets and bake for 1 hour, stirring it up every 15 minutes so it gets evenly toasted.
5 Serve it right away or let it cool down to room temp and store it for your next snack attack. It’ll keep for about 2 weeks.

# modifications

You can do half rice cereal, half corn, some wheat, whateverthefuck you like or is on sale.
 Optional but fucking awesome. If you know you like heat, go up to .25 tsp for delicious results.
 WTF?
Make this mix your own. Sub in bagel chips for the nuts, add more pretzel, whatever the fuck you like. Just keep the total amount of dry shit to 10 cup so that everything gets enough seasoning and you are good to grub.
