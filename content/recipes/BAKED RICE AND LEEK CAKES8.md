# BAKED RICE AND LEEK CAKES

#### yields  24 CAKES, ENOUGH FOR 6 TO 8 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 12 ounces extra-firm silken tofu
* 1 TBL rice vinegar
* 1 TBL toasted sesame oil
* 1 TBL soy sauce or tamari
* 1 tsp neutral oil, such as grapeseed
* 2 cup diced leeks
* ½ cup minced chives or green onions
* 1 TBL minced fresh ginger
* 2 clove garlic
* 2 ½ cup cooked short-grain white or brown rice
* 1 ¼ cup panko bread crumbs
* Spray oil
* Sweet Sesame Teriyaki-Style Sauce

# instructions
1 Crank up your oven to 425°F. Set a baking sheet aside.
2 Throw the tofu, vinegar, sesame oil, and soy sauce or tamari together in a blender or food processor and run that    until that beany mother er looks smooth.
3 In a large wok or skillet, heat up the grapeseed oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook them until they start to look a little translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chives, ginger, and garlic and cook for another minute, just so everything gets mixed the   up. Then remove from the heat.
4 Add the tofu mixture and cooked rice to the pan with the leeks and mix that   . Add in .25 cup of the panko and keep mixing until everything is all combined and there aren’t any goddamn pockets of rice hiding out and refusing to cooperate.
5 To make the cakes, pour the remaining 1 cup panko onto a plate. Grab about a golf ball’s worth of filling and press it into a kind of patty shape. Your hands are gonna get messy, but just  deal with it. The mixture will be a little wetter than you think it should be, but you’re wrong so just trust the method and move the   on. Coat the patty with the panko by gently pressing it into the crumbs, then place it on the baking sheet.
6 Keep going until you’ve run out of patties. Ya know, the obvious place to stop. Spray them all lightly with a little oil and bake, turning them halfway, until both sides are golden, about 30 minutes. Serve with the dipping sauce on the side.

WTF?
 See House Rules.
 This could be leftover rice or freshly made, it’s not going to  matter. No clue how to make rice at home because you grew up with that Minute   ?
 WTF?
