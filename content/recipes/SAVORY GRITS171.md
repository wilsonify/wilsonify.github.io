# SAVORY GRITS
#### yields 6 cup
## ingredients
* 3 1/2 cup vegetable broth or water* 3 1/2 cup vegetable broth or watern* 3 1/2 cup vegetable broth or water* 3 1/2 cup vegetable broth or water* 3 1/2 cup vegetable broth or water

* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast

# instructions
1 Grab a large pot and bring the broth and milk to a boil over medium heat. Gently whisk in the grits and the salt. Don’t just dump all the grits in there and get them all clumpy and fucked up from the start. Bring it all to a boil and then reduce that heat to low. Cover the pot and let that deliciousness simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Stir the fucker on occasion, because if it gets too hot, it’s corny ass will stick to the bottom.
2 When the grits have absorbed most of the liquid and are tender, turn off the heat and stir in the nutritional yeast.

# modifications

Almond milk is fine, use whatever you want.
 Not that instant shit.
 WTF?
