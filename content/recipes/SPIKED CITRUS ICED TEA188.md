# SPIKED CITRUS ICED TEA



#### yields  8 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 1 gallon water 
* 8 black tea bags 
* 1/4-1/2 cup maple syrup 
* 2 1/2 cup whiskey 
* 1/2 cup orange juice 
* 1/3 cup lemon juice 
* Ice 
* Orange and lemon slices, for garnish 



## Instructions
1 In a large pot, heat the water over medium-high heat until you see bubbles forming on the bottom. You don’t need to fucking boil it. Turn off the heat and add the tea bags. Let them chill out in the hot water for about 5 minutes. You know, steeping and shit.

2 Pull the bags out and add the .25 cup maple syrup, the whiskey, and citrus juices. Stir and taste. If you like it a little sweeter, just fucking add some more syrup.

3 Let the tea sit in the fridge until it’s cool. Serve this summertime staple with some ice and orange or lemon slices because then it looks classy as hell.

Maple syrup can be expensive, so feel free to sub it with whatthefuckever liquid sweetener you’ve got, like agave.

Optional, but c’mon.

Cut extra half-moons of fruit and stick them on the rims of the glasses so people can pretend they’re being sophisticated and not just trying to get sideways on a Sunday.
