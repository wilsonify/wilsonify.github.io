# YELLOW SPLIT PEA AND GREEN ONION LETTUCE WRAPS



#### yields  12 TO 14 LETTUCE WRAPS


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup yellow split peas 
* 3 cup water 
* Salt 
* 2 TBL soy sauce or tamari 
* 2 TBL water 
* 2 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1-2 tsp of your favorite Asian-style hot sauce 
* 1 tsp toasted sesame oil 
* 1 tsp of your favorite liquid sweetener 
* 2 tsp neutral-tasting oil 
* 1/2 cup shallots or yellow onion 
* 2 tsp minced fresh ginger 
* 1 cup minced green onions 
* 2/3 cup shredded carrot 
* 3 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1 1/2 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil 
* 1 head of lettuce such as romaine or red leaf 



## Instructions
1 Rinse the peas well and then throw them in a medium pot with the water and a pinch of salt

and bring them to a boil. Reduce the heat and let those sons of bitches simmer until they are

tender, 10 to 15 minutes. You can figure that shit out just by tasting them. When the peas are

done, drain them and set aside.

2 While the peas are cooking, mix together all the ingredients for the dipping sauce in a small

bowl.

3 Grab a big wok or skillet and heat the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and sauté

until they start to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Add the ginger and green onions and let it all

cook together for another 30 seconds. Add the split peas and carrots, toss, then add the rice

vinegar and soy sauce. Let that simmer together for another 30 seconds while you stir. Add the

toasted sesame oil and then turn off the heat.

4 Serve the filling warm or at room temperature with a bunch of lettuce leaves to use as leafy

tortillas. Keep the dipping sauce on the side. Looks like a good fucking time.



## Modifications
Optional but you really should try new shit.

 Agave or maple syrup would do if that’s what you’ve got.

 Use your box grater.
