# ROASTED POTATO SALAD WITH FRESH HERBS



#### yields  4 AS A SIDE


## ingredients
* small white or yellow potatoes, unpeeled 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (optional)
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1/2 cup diced fresh parsley 
* 1/2 cup sliced green onions 
* 1 clove garlic 
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 2 TBL red wine vinegar 
* 1 TBL water 
* 1 tsp lemon juice 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 400°F.

2 Slice the potatoes in half lengthwise. If for some reason your little potatoes are not bite-size,

then cut those fuckers into quarters instead and throw them in a bowl. Toss the potatoes with

the olive oil, paprika, and salt until they all look covered. Pour them onto a rimmed baking

sheet in a single layer and roast the hell outta them for 25 minutes, flipping them over halfway

through.

3 While the potatoes are roasting, make that herb sauce. You can throw all the ingredients

into a food processor and let it rip until everything is minced and mixed together, or you could

just mince and mix by hand if you don’t want to create another dirty dish.

4 When the potatoes are tender, let them cool for about 10 minutes. Pour them into a large

bowl and cover them with the herb sauce, making sure every spud gets some love. Taste and

add some salt and pepper until it’s howeverthefuck you like it. Stick it in the fridge for at least

1 hour so that the potatoes can absorb all that flavor and the garlic can mellow the fuck out.

Serve cold or at room temperature.



## Modifications
Optional but dope
