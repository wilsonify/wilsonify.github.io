# PEAR AND POPPY SEED LB CAKE



#### yields  1 LOAF


## ingredients
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 1 tsp almond extract 
* 2 cup flour 
* 2 tsp baking powder 
* 2 tsp poppy seeds 
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom 
* 1 1/4 cup grated pear (about 1 big one) 



## Instructions
1 Warm up the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9 x -5-inch loaf pan.

2 Throw the butter and the sugar together in a medium bowl. Beat those fuckers together with an electric mixer on medium speed until it looks fluffy, almost frosting like. Beat in the yogurt, milk, and extracts until those guys are all mixed in. Add 1 cup of the flour, turn the mixer to low, and mix that fucker until they just start combining. Add the remaining 1 cup flour, the baking powder, poppy seeds, and cardamom and beat that sweet motherfucker again until everything just starts getting mixed up. Fold in the grated pear with a spatula and stir it around just enough that there isn’t a giant pear colony somewhere in that batter.

3 Grab the loaf pan and pour that shit in, kinda smoothing out the top. Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the top looks golden and a toothpick stuck in it doesn’t come out covered in raw batter, about 55 minutes. Let it cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then pull it out and let it cool to room temperature on a wire rack.

4 Serve it just like this with some tea or spoonful of whipped cream if you’re livin’ it up like that.



## Modifications
Yeah, it’s a goddamn dessert. Calm down.

 It’s cool to skip the almond extract and use all vanilla if that is what you’ve got in your place.

 Cardamom is legit as hell and can be found in stuff like your favorite curries and chais. If your store doesn’t carry it, they fucking suck. You can sub in cinnamon but def use cardamom if you can find it.
