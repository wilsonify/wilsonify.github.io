# RED CURRY LIME SAUCE
## ingredients
* 1 cup vegetable broth* 1 cup vegetable brothy* 1 cup vegetable broth* 1 cup vegetable broth* 1 cup vegetable brothc* 1 cup vegetable broth* 1 cup vegetable broth* 1 cup vegetable brothu* 1 cup vegetable broth* 1 cup vegetable broth

* 1 TBL cornstarch or arrowroot powder


# instructions
1 Measure out 1 TBL of the vegetable broth and set it aside in a small glass.
2 Put the rest of the broth in a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer. Add the curry paste,
lime zest, lime juice, ginger, peanut butter, sugar, soy sauce, and garlic. Mix it all up and make
sure there arenâ€™t any curry or peanut butter chunks.
3 Mix together the cornstarch with the broth you put in the small glass until there are no
more chunks. This is going to thicken up that watery-ass sauce, just wait. Pour this into the
simmering sauce and whisk until the sauce starts getting nice and thick, about 1 minute. Turn
off the heat, taste, and add more garlic, lime juice, or whatever your tongue is craving. Let it
cool for at least a couple minutes before serving.
