# POPPY SEED PROTEIN WAFFLES



#### yields  4 BIG-ASS WAFFLES, BUT THIS VARIES DEPENDING ON YOUR WAFFLE MAKER


## ingredients
* 12 ounces soft silken tofu 
* 1 1/2 cup nondairy milk, such as almond 
* 1 TBL vanilla extract 
* Grated zest of 1 lemon (about 1 TBL) 
* 2 TBL lemon juice 
* 2 cup flour 
* 1/4 cup sugar 
* 2 tsp baking powder 
* 1 tsp baking soda 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 2 TBL poppy seeds 
* Spray oil 
* Maple syrup, seasonal fruit 



## Instructions
1 Warm up the waffle iron.

2 In a small blender, mix together the tofu, milk, vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice and run that shit until everything is mixed up and looking smooth.

3 In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt so that they’re all mixed up. Make a well in the center and add the tofu/milk mixture. Whisk everything together until it is just kinda starting to combine and then fold in the poppy seeds. Keep mixing until there aren’t any more dry spots and only a few lumps, no need to go crazy.

4 Spray the warmed-up waffle iron with some oil so those bitches won’t stick, then pour in some batter. Cook until golden brown according to your waffle maker’s directions. Cover with maple syrup, whatever fruit that’s in season, and serve hot. Then make those lazy bastards we mentioned earlier clean up the kitchen.



## Modifications
No clue on how to do this zest shit?

 Not required but the waffles are way better with them.
