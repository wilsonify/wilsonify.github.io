Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.<br>2 Cut the zucchini into coins a little thicker than a quarter. If you cut them too thin they will<br>burn the fuck up in the oven. If your slices start releasing some liquid, dab them with a towel<br>to dry them off. Mix together the flour, paprika, garlic powder, and salt in a medium bowl.<br>Toss in the zucchini and mix them together until all the zucchini pieces are coated in flavor.<br>3 Lay the zucchini on the baking sheet and coat the slices lightly with cooking spray. Bake for<br>30 to 40 minutes, flipping them over every 10 minutes, until they are all golden and crisp. Keep<br>your eye on them because they can go from perfectly crispy to burnt to shit in a hot second.<br>They are best served the day they are made so that crunch stays intact.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>Whole wheat, white, rice, whatever you got is fine.</p></div></div>
