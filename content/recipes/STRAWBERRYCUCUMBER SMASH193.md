# STRAWBERRY-CUCUMBER SMASH



## ingredients
* 6 slices (.25 inch thick) cucumber 
* 12 fresh mint leaves (optional)
* 1/2 cup gin 
* 1-2 tsp of your favorite liquid sweetener like agave syrup 
* Ice 
* 1/2 cup tonic or sparkling water 



## Instructions
1 Grab a big-ass jar with a tight-fitting lid. Throw in the strawberries, cucumber, mint (if you’re using it), gin, 1 tsp agave, and a big handful of ice.

2 Shake the ever-living fuck out of it until the gin looks all pink and lovely and the mint is beat to shit. Were your strawberries not supersweet? Got a bunk batch at the store? Just add a little extra agave and shake again.

3 Grab 2 glasses and throw in a couple ice cubes and the tonic. Strain the smash into each glass, making sure all the pulpy shit stays out. Serve right away before you accidently down both drinks yourself and have to start the whole fucking thing over before anyone notices.

Optional, but who the fuck doesn’t like mint? Ants, that’s who.

Better with it, but optional.
