# TOFU SCRAMBLE TACOS



#### yields  8 TACOS


## ingredients
* 1 small crown broccoli 
* 1 red bell pepper 
* 1 yellow onion 
* 1 carrot 
* 4 clove garlic 
* 1-2 jalapeños 
* 1 TBL ground cumin 
* 1 TBL chili powder 
* 2 tsp dried oregano 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 block extra-firm tofu 
* 2-3 tsp soy sauce 
* 2 TBL lemon or lime juice 
* 1/3 cup nutritional yeast 
* 2 tsp hot sauce 
* 8 tortillas 



## Instructions

1 Chop up the broccoli into pieces no larger than a nickel, aiming for about 2 cup. 

Dice the bell pepper and onion into pea-size pieces. 

Shred the carrot on that box grater you think you bought a while back. 

Mince the garlic and jalapeño. 

In a small bowl, mix together the cumin, chili powder, and oregano and set that aside. 

2 Now it’s time to cook. 

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. 

Add the onion and cook until it starts to look golden around the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. 

Now add the chopped broccoli and bell pepper and cook until the broccoli starts to get tender but isn’t all 
limp, another 3 to 4 minutes. 

Now add the garlic and jalapeño and sauté for about 30 seconds. 

3 While that is going on, drain the tofu and squeeze out as much water as possible. 

(You can just use your hands; no need to press.) 

Now crumble that tofu into the pan in quarter-size chunks. 

Some small bits are cool but its better to start bigger and work to smaller, you know?

Sauté that tofu around with the veggies for 2 to 3 minutes and try to get it all mixed in. 

If the pan starts looking dry, add a splash of water. 

Add the soy sauce and lemon/lime juice all over the pan. 

Add the spice blend, shredded carrot, and nutritional yeast right after and stir. 

Let cook together for about 2 minutes so that the flavors blend. 

Top with the hot sauce, stir, and then pile the filling into your waiting tortillas.

Serve with avocados, fresh cilantro, and your favorite salsa.

## Modifications

Remove the seeds for less heat.
