</div><div class="ing"><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul class="ing"><li class="ing" i3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.<br>2 In the large bowl of a stand mixer or just a big-ass bowl, mix together the almond butter<br>and sugars until it looks kinda creamy and fluffy. Slowly add in the ground flaxseed, almond<br>milk, and vanilla until a loose batter forms in there.<br>3 When all of that is mixed up, add the sifted flour stuff slowly into the bowl. Mix that up<br>until there are no more dry spots. Fold in the chocolate chips, cover, and put that tasty-ass<br>batter in the fridge for at least 1 hour and for up to 2 days.<br>4 When you are ready for some cookies, heat your oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with<br>parchment paper.<br>5 Scoop out a spoonful of dough onto the sheet and kind of flatten it out a bit until you get<br>about a 2-inch-wide cookie. Keep going until you fucking run out of dough and then bake<br>until the bottoms are nice and golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Take them off the sheet and let them<br>cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before serving.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>It really helps the dough come together if this shit is cold, so just stick it in the fridge. You could use peanut butter if that’s all you got, but that is a totally different kind of cookie—just know that shit.<br> Depends on how much chocolate you like in your cookies. That’s your fucking call.</p></div></div>
