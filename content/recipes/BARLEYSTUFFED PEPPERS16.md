# BARLEY-STUFFED PEPPERS



#### yields  4 STUFFED PEPPERS


## ingredients
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 0.5 onion 
* 2 ribs celery 
* 1 carrot 
* 3 to 4 clove garlic 
* 2 tsp dried thyme 
* 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano 
* 1 cup pearled barley 
* 1 tomato 
* 2 TBL sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar 
* 2 cup vegetable broth 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/4 tsp ground pepper 
* 4 bell peppers, whatever color you find is cool 
* 1 1/2 cup cooked kidney or white beans 
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley 



## Instructions
0 chop onion, celery, carrots, tomato

1 In a medium pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it starts

turning golden, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, garlic, thyme, and oregano and cook

for another 2 minutes. Throw in the barley, tomato, and vinegar and stir. Add the broth, salt,

and pepper and let it come to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, until all the broth is absorbed

and the barley is tender, about 15 minutes.

2 While the barley is simmering, heat your oven to 375°F. Cut the tops off the bell peppers

and scrape out any seeds. Place them in an oiled pie plate or loaf pan, something where their

asses won’t be sliding around once they’re stuffed.

3 When the barley is done, fold in the beans and turn off the heat. (This filling can even be

made a day or two ahead of time, no fucking problem.) Fill the bell peppers up to the top with

the filling, cover them tightly with foil, and bake until the peppers are tender, 45 minutes to 1

hour. Let them rest for 5 minutes after coming out of the oven, ’cause those fuckers are hot.

Top with the parsley and serve.
