# instructions
0 chop onion and apple
1 Sift through the beans and pick out any that look all  ed up. Pour them into a big-ass
bowl with the water and let them soak overnight.
2 When your beans are all softened, it’s time to make some goddamn dinner. Drain the beans.
Grab a large pot and heat the oil over medium heat. Throw in the onion and sauté until it
begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and smoked paprika and cook for another 30
seconds. Add the drained beans, tomato sauce, molasses, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, and
rosemary. Stir it all up and bring it to a simmer, then add the broth. This might look like you
are trying to cast a spell or some    like that, but just go with it.
3 Let all this simmer together until the beans are almost tender. This should take about 1
hour, but it really depends on how old your beans are and how long you soaked them. Once
they are almost done, add the apple. Simmer until the apple is tender and the beans are soft,
about 30 minutes more. Take out that rosemary sprig and serve.

# modifications

Yeah, the whole  branch and everything. The leaves will fall off as you cook, no big deal. Just pull the
stick out when the beans are done.
