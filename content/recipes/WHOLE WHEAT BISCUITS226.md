# WHOLE WHEAT BISCUITS



#### yields  8 BISCUITS


## ingredients
* 1 cup almond or other nondairy milk 
* 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar 
* 2 1/2 cup flour 
* 1 TBL baking powder 
* 2 tsp sugar 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/4 cup butter 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with some parchment paper.

2 Mix together the milk and vinegar in a small glass and set it out of the way for a minute.

3 Sift the flours, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Crumble the oil

into the flour a TBL at a time using your fingers and break up into pieces a little bigger

than a pea. It should look kinda like coarse sand from a shitty playground, minus the broken

glass. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk mixture. Stir until a shaggy dough is

formed, but be careful not to over-mix because then you will have some tough biscuits. If it is

too dry to stick together, add a TBL or two of milk.

4 Turn the dough out on a floured surface and pat it into a roughly 8 x 5-inch rectangle about

1.5 inches thick. using the open end of a glass or biscuit cutter, cut out all the motherfucking

biscuits you can and put them on the baking sheet. You should end up with about 8.

5 Bake the biscuits until the bottoms are golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Let them cool for a

minute before digging in or go ahead and start the day by burning the fuck out of your taste

buds, you dumbass.



## Modifications
flour is really similar to all-purpose flour in texture and taste but contains all the good bran

and germ stuff like you find in whole wheat flour. Basically, it is the shit. If you can’t find it, use whole wheat or

all-purpose instead.

 Yeah, don’t bitch. In the quest for a fluffy biscuit, it had to be done.

 This needs to be all opaque and solid like butter. If it is clear and runny because it is hot outside, this won’t

fucking work. Stick it in the fridge until it gets its act together.
