# MIXED VEGGIE AND TOFU CHILAQUILES



#### yields  4 TO 6


## ingredients
* 12 corn tortillas 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 block medium-firm tofu 
* 2 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 tsp garlic powder 
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast 
* 1/2 medium onion 
* 1 bell pepper 
* 1-2 jalapeños 
* 2 clove garlic 
* 2-3 cup fresh spinach 
* 2 1/2 cup salsa verde 
* 1/4 cup vegetable broth 
* 1 avocado (optional)
* 1 cilantro (optional)
* 1 jalapeño (optional)
* 1 pico de gallo (optional)



## Instructions
0 chop the onion and bell pepper and jalapenos. mince the garlic.

1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Cut your tortillas up into 8 wedges, like a motherfucking pizza.

Spread the wedges out on a baking sheet and throw them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes to

dry out. Stir them around halfway through. It’s fine if they start to get hard in some spots but

don’t let them fucking burn.

2 While the tortillas get crispy, grab a big skillet and do the damn thing. Heat up 1 tsp

of the oil over a medium heat and crumble in the tofu. It might be a little watery, but don’t

worry about that shit. Think runny scrambled eggs. Stir in the soy sauce and garlic powder and

let it all cook together until some of that water cooks off, about 2 minutes. Stir in the nutritional yeast,

turn off the heat, and pour the tofu into a bowl. Wipe the skillet down and throw that

motherfucker right back on the stove cause we ain’t done yet.

3 Heat up that second tsp of oil over medium heat. Throw in the onion, bell pepper, and

jalapeños and sauté until the onion starts to look a little brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic

and spinach and cook for 30 seconds more.

4 The baked tortillas should be done now, so throw about half of them in with the veggies in

the skillet. Add 1 cup of the salsa and 2 TBL of the broth and mix all of that together.

Add half of the tofu over the whole skillet and then layer on the rest of the tortillas. Top with

the rest of the tofu, salsa, and broth and gently stir it around to make sure the layers are

coated. A dry bite of chilaquiles can be a fucking bummer, so pay attention. Let this all simmer

together for about 5 minutes so that the tortillas soften up and the liquid evaporates. The

dope smell of cooking this will drag even the laziest motherfucker out of bed. Believe that shit.

5 Serve right away topped with sliced avocado, a sprinkle of cilantro, more jalapeños, and pico

de gallo. Don’t share until someone else promises to wash the goddamn dishes.



## Modifications
You want the kind packed in water that is sold in the fridge at the store, so make sure to drain that shit before you start cooking.
