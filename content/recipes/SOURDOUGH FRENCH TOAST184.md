# SOURDOUGH FRENCH TOAST


<p class="i>
* Cooking spray 



## Instructions
1 In a pie pan or similar shallow dish, mix together the ground chia seeds and flour. Slowly

whisk in the milk so that shit doesn’t get all lumpy. SLOWLY, MOTHERFUCKER. Now

let that sit for 15 minutes. Make your sleepy ass some coffee and then cut the bread up into 1-

inch-thick slices while you wait.

2 Whisk the batter after about 15 minutes and then slowly add the nutritional yeast and stir.

Heat a griddle or heavy pan over a medium heat and coat with a little cooking spray so these

bitches don’t stick. Soak your bread slices in the batter for a couple seconds on each side and

then throw them right on the griddle. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes a side, or until they look

golden and tasty as fuck all over.



## Modifications
6 PIECES OF FRENCH TOAST
