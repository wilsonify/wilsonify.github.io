* 1/2 yellow onion 
* 1 LB okra 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 2 TBL cornmeal 
* 1 dash ground pepper 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1/2 tsp paprika ng sheet and put that motherfucker in the oven. After about 20 minutes, add the garlic

and rosemary to the potato side of the sheet and stir that up. Stir the okra around too and put

that fucker right back in the oven to finish cooking. Bake until the okra starts to brown and

crisp up, another 20 to 25 minutes.

4 When the okra is crispy and the potatoes are browned and tender, take it out of the oven and

sprinkle the lemon juice over the entire dish. Mix the potatoes and okra together and serve

immediately with your favorite hot sauce.

GREEN SMOOTHIES SHOULDN’T TASTE LIKE GRASS

Green smoothies are an easy way to get more fruits and veggies into your diet.

You can get a dose of fiber, chlorophyll, essential vitamins, and all kinds of other

good stuff your body needs in one glass. That is some simple shit. Don’t

overthink it.

The greens lay the nutritional groundwork while the sweetness from the fruit

handles the flavor labor. But don’t go to some buttoned-up juice bar across town

for an expensive-ass neon green smoothie that tastes like grass clippings. FUCK.

THAT. Toss some fruits and veggies in a blender and press a fucking button.

You know what you like, so be your own green smoothie guru at home. It’s

faster, cheaper, and no long-ass line. Here’s a guide to how you want to structure

your smoothie experiments:

2 cup of greens like spinach or kale, whatever you got. (If you have a shitty

blender, stick to something easier to blend, like spinach.)

1 cup chunks of creamy fruit (like frozen bananas or mangoes or an avocado)

.75 cup of your favorite sweet frozen fruits (like cherries, berries, apples, pears

—use your fucking imagination)

11⁄2 cup liquid. This can be a combo of your favorite juice, milk, and water or

all water depending on how much sweetness you are after.

Try out some of these combos to get your brain working before you come up

with your own shit: tropical fruits like mangoes and pineapples with some

coconut milk and water; blueberries or blackberries with almond milk; or do all

bananas and sub in peanut butter for .25 cup of the liquids and do the rest with

almond milk and water. If it sounds good enough to eat together, then trust that

shit will be dope to drink, too.
