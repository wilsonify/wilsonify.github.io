# Szechuan Tofu Chili

## Ingredients:

- 2 tablespoons Szechuan peppercorns
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 pound ground pork
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste
- 6 large shallots, finely chopped (about 1 1/4 cups)
- 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped (2 tablespoons)
- 1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped (2 tablespoons)
- 2 (1/2-ounce) serrano or fresh green Thai chiles, seeded (if desired) and finely chopped (2 tablespoons)
- 1/4 cup doubanjiang
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 2 cups lower-sodium chicken broth
- 3 cups cooked black beans in cooking liquid
- 1 (16-ounce) package silken tofu, carefully cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 2 cups)
- Sliced scallions, for garnish
- Hot steamed rice, for serving

## Directions:

1. Grind Szechuan peppercorns in a mortar until finely ground. Set aside.

2. Heat canola oil in a large enamel-coated cast-iron braiser or a deep skillet over medium-high heat.

3. Add ground beef to the heated oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Cook until nearly cooked through, breaking up the beef with a wooden spoon as it cooks, about 5 minutes.

4. Add shallots, garlic, ginger, and chiles to the skillet. Cook, stirring often, until shallots are softened, about 3 minutes.

5. Stir in doubanjiang, white wine, soy sauce, and the ground Szechuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and beef is fully coated, about 1 minute.

6. Add crushed tomatoes and chicken broth to the skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and beef is tender, about 10 minutes.

7. Stir in the remaining 1 teaspoon of kosher salt.

8. Gently stir in black beans with their cooking liquid and tofu. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook undisturbed until heated through and flavors meld, about 10 minutes.

9. Season with additional salt to taste if needed.

10. Garnish with sliced scallions and serve with hot steamed rice.
