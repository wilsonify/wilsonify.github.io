# ROASTED CAULIFLOWER AND MUSHROOM BANH MI



#### yields  6 FULL-SIZE SANDWICHES OR 12 HALF SANDWICHES BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MATH


## ingredients
* 2 TBL soy sauce or tamari 
* 3 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1 TBL lime juice 
* 1 TBL neutral oil, such as grapeseed 
* 2 tsp brown sugar 
* 1 tsp Ss">Optional toppers: cilantro, mint, cucumber rounds, jalapeño slices 



## Instructions
0 cut radishes and carrots into matchsticks.

1 Prepare the vegetables: In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce or tamari, vinegar, lime juice, oil, sugar, and hot sauce. Add the cauliflower and mushrooms and let them sit for about 15 minutes but no longer than 2 hours. When you’re ready to get going, start warming up the oven to 400°F and grab a baking sheet.

2 In a medium bowl, mix together the panko and the curry powder. Drain the cauliflower and mushrooms then toss those fibrous bastards in the panko mix along with the shallots and ginger. Mix that all up until everything looks coated and pour it out onto the baking sheet. Roast, stirring it up halfway, until the cauliflower is starting to look nice and crispy, about 25 minutes.

3 While the cauliflower mixture is roasting you have time to get the rest of the shit together. Don’t look at your phone; that shit will only distract you and you’re on sandwich duty. To make the slaw: Just throw the radishes, carrots, vinegar, soy sauce or tamari, lime juice, and agave together in a bowl and toss it. So. Fucking. Simple.

4 Make the aioli if you are using it and get the rest of your toppings in order. You got this shit.

5 When the vegetables are all roasted and looking right, spread your sammie-size baguette pieces with some aioli and fill up with slaw, cilantro, and all the rest of the toppers. Pile the roasted vegetables high inside the bread and keep making sammies until you run out of bread. Serve hot or at room temp. These badasses taste great no matter what the fuck you do. Serve these the day you make them though, so that the panko stays crispy and delicious. You’re fucking welcome.



## Modifications
You'll need about 1 small crown cauliflower. And florets are just little-ass trees, don’t freak the fuck out.

 You should get about 1.5 cup sliced mushrooms. Can’t find shiitakes? Just do button instead, but try to keep the strips from being too thick because that will not be nearly as fucking tasty.

 WTF is that?
