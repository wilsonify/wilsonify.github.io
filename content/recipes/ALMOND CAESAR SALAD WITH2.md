# instructions
0 chop up the lettuce
1 Put the almonds in a glass with the hot water and let those  ers soak for about 15
minutes. Chop up the garlic. When the almonds start feeling sorta soft, throw them in a food
processor or blender with the water they soaked in, the garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, mustard,
and vinegar. Blend it all up until there are no more large almond pieces and it starts to look
creamy. You know what the   Caesar dressing should look like, come on. Add the capers
and run it again for another 5 seconds just so they get chopped up. Chill until you are ready to
eat.
2 Serve a couple TBL of the dressing over your favorite lettuce with homemade
croutons because you know how to live.

These pickled mother ers are near the olives at the store. They sound all fancy, but 1 jar will last you forever
and class up your fridge. Throw them in the House Marinara with some olives and red pepper flakes and you got 109
yourself a puttanesca, you crazy mother er.
