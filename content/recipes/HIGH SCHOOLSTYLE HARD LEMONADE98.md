# HIGH SCHOOL–STYLE HARD LEMONADE



#### yields  1 QUART


## ingredients
* 5 cup water 
* 0.5 to ¾ cup sugar 
* 3/4 cup lemon juice (about 6 lemons) 
* 1 tsp lime juice 
* 1/2 cup vodka, or more if reasons 
* Lemon wedges and mint sprigs, for garnish 



## Instructions
1 In a medium pot, bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add .5 cup sugar and simmer that shit over low heat for about 5 minutes. Make sure to stir it on the regular. The sugar should be all dissolved in the water with no little fucking grains rolling around in there.

2 Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice, lime juice, and vodka. Let it cool until it is around room temperature. Put the lemonade in the fridge to cool down all the way in some kinda container or an old juice bottle. Taste and add the rest of the sugar or more vodka if you need that shit.

3 Serve with lemon wedges and some sprigs of mint if you want it to look fucking impressive.



## Modifications
Yeah, without all the sugar it’s really just sour fucking water.

 21 and up motherfucker. No ID? Replace this with water.

Leave permanent markers out next to your cup so guests can write their names or draw some shit labeling their cup. Otherwise watch a dozen people blow thru 100 cup in 30 minutes like FUCK THE ENVIRONMENT.
