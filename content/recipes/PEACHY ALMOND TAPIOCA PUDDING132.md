<li  go more than 16<br>hours, though. Shit gets weird after that.<br>2 When you are ready to cook, drain the tapioca pearls. Put them in a medium saucepan with<br>the juice, almond milk, salt, and vanilla. If your juice isn’t super sweet, then go ahead and add<br>the agave. Just fucking taste it and you will figure it out. Warm the pot over low heat and stir<br>constantly. You don’t want it bubbling or anything, so pay attention and don’t fucking stop<br>stirring. At around 8 to 10 minutes it should start thickening up and the pearls should start<br>looking clear. Keep stirring until it is about the same consistency as a thick soup or gravy,<br>about a minute more. Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Pour the pudding into a<br>medium bowl and put in the fridge to cool.<br>3 Let it sit for 3 to 4 hours, otherwise you’ll be eating hot pudding and that shit is gross. If it<br>thickens up too much in the fridge, just stir it up real good and add an extra TBL of<br>peach juice. Top the tapioca with blueberries and serve.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>These little white balls are usually sold in bags in the baking aisle of the store or just look on the Internet. They<br>are the starch that helps this thicken up so don’t even fucking think about leaving them out.<br> You can use whatever the fuck kind of juice you want, just not something real acidic like orange. Peach-apple<br>juice is a good one, too.</p></div></div>
