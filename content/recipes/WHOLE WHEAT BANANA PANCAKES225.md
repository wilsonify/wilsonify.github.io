# WHOLE WHEAT BANANA PANCAKES



#### yields  12 PANCAKES


## ingredients
* 2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
* 2 TBL brown or white sugar 
* 2 tsp baking soda 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 2 cup nondairy milk (like almond) 
* 1 small banana, mashed 
* 1 TBL Grapeseed oil 



## Instructions
1 In a big bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Make a crater in the

middle and add the milk and mashed up banana. Mix that all together until there are no more

dry spots, but donâ€™t go crazy. Mixing it too much will make your pancakes tough, so just chill

the fuck out sir mix-a-lot.

2 Now, you probably know what to do once the batter is done, but in case this is your first

time at the griddle, keep reading. Grab a skillet or griddle and heat it over medium heat.

Lightly grease the pan with some oil and pour some pancake batter onto the griddle for each

pancake you want. Cook the first side for about 2 minutes or until bubbles appear on top. The

bubbles mean your pancake has cooked through. Flip and continue cooking the other side for 1

to 2 minutes or until the pancake looks golden brown.



## Modifications
This should be around .33 cup.
