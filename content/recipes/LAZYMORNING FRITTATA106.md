# instructions
roast the bell peppers
0 chop onion, peppers, and broccoli
1 Warm up your oven to 350°F. Grease up a pie pan or similar-size baking dish.
2 In a large skillet, warm up the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté it around until it starts to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the roasted bell peppers, broccoli, and mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms start releasing their liquid, about 3 minutes. Add the kale, garlic, and salt and cook all of that together until the kale starts to wilt, 3 to 4 more minutes. Add the basil, thyme, oregano, and a dash of black pepper and cook for 1 more minute to warm up the herbs, and then turn the fucking heat off.
3 Throw the tofu, chickpeas, milk, and lemon juice into a blender or food processor and run that shit until it looks sort of smooth. A couple of chickpea chunks are cool, so don’t stress. Pour this into the skillet full of veggies, sprinkle in the nutritional yeast, and mix it up so everything is combined. Spread this all into the greased pie pan in an even layer, place the tomato slices on top, spray with a little oil, and throw that fucker right in the oven.
4 Bake until it looks set and is kinda golden around the edges, 30 to 40 minutes. Let it sit for about 15 minutes before slicing so it doesn’t just fall apart. Cut into slices like a pie and serve warm.

WTF?
 This is about two-thirds of a 15-ounce can of chickpeas. Just save the rest of that shit for a salad or something.
 WTF?
