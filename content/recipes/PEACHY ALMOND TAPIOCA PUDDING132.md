# PEACHY ALMOND TAPIOCA PUDDING



#### yields  4 NORMAL PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 2 cup water 
<li  go more than 16

hours, though. Shit gets weird after that.

2 When you are ready to cook, drain the tapioca pearls. Put them in a medium saucepan with

the juice, almond milk, salt, and vanilla. If your juice isn’t super sweet, then go ahead and add

the agave. Just fucking taste it and you will figure it out. Warm the pot over low heat and stir

constantly. You don’t want it bubbling or anything, so pay attention and don’t fucking stop

stirring. At around 8 to 10 minutes it should start thickening up and the pearls should start

looking clear. Keep stirring until it is about the same consistency as a thick soup or gravy,

about a minute more. Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Pour the pudding into a

medium bowl and put in the fridge to cool.

3 Let it sit for 3 to 4 hours, otherwise you’ll be eating hot pudding and that shit is gross. If it

thickens up too much in the fridge, just stir it up real good and add an extra TBL of

peach juice. Top the tapioca with blueberries and serve.



## Modifications
These little white balls are usually sold in bags in the baking aisle of the store or just look on the Internet. They

are the starch that helps this thicken up so don’t even fucking think about leaving them out.

 You can use whatever the fuck kind of juice you want, just not something real acidic like orange. Peach-apple

juice is a good one, too.
