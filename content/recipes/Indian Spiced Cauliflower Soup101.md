# instructions
Heat oil in the bottom of a 4 to 5-quart pot over medium-high heat. 

Once hot, add the cumin seeds and a few seconds later, the fennel seeds. 

Pause 2 seconds and then add the onions and potatoes. 

Stir and sauté for 5 minutes. 
Add the ginger, garlic and green chiles and stir for 1 minute more.

Turn the heat to medium low 
and add the ground coriander, cumin, turmeric and red pepper.

Stir for 1 minute. 
Add the cauliflower, tomatoes and salt and stir for 1 minute. 
Add 4 cups water, stir, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
Cover, lower the heat again, and simmer gently for 25 minutes.

Let the soup cool slightly, then blend it to your desired texture. 
Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed. 
Ladle into bowls and add a dollop of yogurt or tiny swirl (about 1/2 teaspoon) heavy cream, if desired. 
Squeeze lime juice over, add a few grinds of black pepper and place 2 tablespoons cooked rice to the center of each bowl. 
Scatter with cilantro and serve with pita wedges on the side, if desired. Dig in.
