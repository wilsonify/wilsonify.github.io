# CRUTONS

## ingredients
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 1/4 tsp paprika 
* 1/4 tsp salt 

## Instructions
0 cube the bread (enough to make 5 cup of cubes)

1 Crank your oven to 400°F.

2 Cut up the bread into bite-size cubes. You should get around 5 cup. In a big bowl, combine

the rest of the ingredients and mix. Add the bread pieces and mix that fucker up to make sure

all the pieces get some love. Pour that out evenly onto a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes,

stirring halfway through to make sure that shit doesn’t burn. Serve right away or keep them in

an airtight container in the fridge.
