# TORTILLA SOUP

#### yields  4 AS A MAIN, 6 AS A SIDE

## ingredients
* 1 yellow or white onion 
* 1 carrot 
* 1 bell pepper 
* 1 to 2 jalapeños 
* 4 clove garlic 
* 1 TBL olive oil 
* 2 1/2 tsp each ground cumin, dried oregano, and chili powder 
* 1/8 tsp salt 
* 1 can (14.5 ounces) low-salt diced tomatoes 
* 1/4 cup tomato paste 
* 5 cup vegetable broth 
* 1 TBL lime juice 
* 6-8 corn tortillas, cut into 1-inch squares 
* 1 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas 
* Toppings: Chopped cilantro, minced jalapeños, avocado, shake from the bottom of your 
* tortilla chip bag 



## Instructions
1 Chop up the onion, carrot, and bell pepper into pieces about the size of a chickpea. Mince

the garlic and jalapeños. Now you’re ready to get down to business.

2 Grab a large soup pot and sauté the onion in the oil until it starts to look a little see-

through, about 2 minutes. Add the carrot and bell pepper and cook until everything is golden,

another 3 minutes. Add the jalapeños, garlic, spices, and salt and cook for another 30 seconds.

This should smell pretty goddamn dope right about now. Add the diced tomatoes and tomato

paste. Make sure that you stir enough so that the paste isn’t just

sitting in a clump. Add the broth and let that all come to a simmer.

3 Now it’s time to take this mother er up a notch. Add the lime juice and tortilla squares.

Stir everything up and let that all gently simmer together until the tortillas get nice and soft,

about 10 minutes. Now turn off the heat and grab your immersion blender and pulverize 

until it’s nice and smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can throw this

all in your regular blender in batches too. Your call. Taste and add more of whatever you think

it needs.

4 Serve this up with chickpeas piled in the center of each bowl, with chunks of avocado, some

minced jalapeño, and some cilantro. Chip shake is welcome, too.



## Modifications
Regular or fire-roasted would be dope here.

 If you like a thicker soup, go with 8.

 Or one 15-ounce can
