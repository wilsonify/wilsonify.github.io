# SPARKLING WINTER CITRUS AND GIN PUNCH
#### yields  9 cup

## ingredients
* 2 bottles (750ml each) champagne or sparkling wine
* 1 cup fresh grapefruit juice
* ½ cup fresh blood orange or navel orange juice
* 1 ¼ cup gin
* 1 cup sparkling water
* ¼ cup agave syrup or other syrupy sweetener
* Ice
* Grapefruit slices, orange slices, and sprigs of mint or rosemary, for the punch bowl

# instructions
1 Chill everything for a couple of hours before throwing the punch together.
2 Pour the champagne, fruit juices, gin, sparkling water, and agave into a big-ass container like a punch bowl or a giant jar and mix well. Serve right away with plenty of ice. Float grapefruit, orange, mint, and rosemary in the punch bowl to make that shit extra special. Be prepared for guests to be sleeping it off at your place.

# modifications

The sparkling wine does not need to be fancy shit. Anything will do. Also, just make each of your friends bring a bottle and save some cash as the host. Done and done.
 About 3 large grapefruits.
 About 2 large oranges.
 Want to make your agave extra swanky? Add a TBL of water to it and bring it to a simmer on the stovetop. Add 2 sprigs of rosemary and 10 mint leaves and simmer gently for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and let that shit cool. Pick out the herbs and stir this into your punch for extra flavor. Or don’t, who gives a shit. Whatever.
