		<instructions>1 Line a rimmed baking sheet with some parchment or wax paper.
2 Melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler, homemade fake-out, or the microwave. Add the butter to the chocolate chips and stir until everything is melted and mixed together. Remove from the heat.
3 Add the almonds to the melted chocolate and stir that shit up until there’s no more dry clumps of almonds. This is the most work in the whole goddamn recipe: mixing.
4 Once everything is coated, grab a big spoon and dollop piles of the chocolate-almond mixture (about the size of an egg) onto the lined baking sheet. Sprinkle each haystack with some sea salt and then put the baking sheet in a cool area to let the chocolate harden up before diving in, 15 to 45 minutes depending on the temperature in your place. So maybe don’t try this shit on a hot summer day. You can stick this in the fridge if you’re in a rush and have the space.</instructions>
		<modifications>Don’t know how to toast nuts?
 We recommend a salt that is all big and fancy-looking, like large flaky crystals—whatever the best-looking salt you got will do. It’s alright to be judgey with your salt’s appearance. But any salt will do in a pinch.</modifications>
