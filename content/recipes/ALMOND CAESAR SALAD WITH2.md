# Almond Caesar Salad with

#### Yields 4 Side Salads

## Ingredients
- 1/3 cup sliced or slivered almonds
- 1 TBL capers
- 1 handful croutons

## Instructions

1. Chop up the lettuce.

2. Put the almonds in a glass with hot water and let them soak for about 15 minutes.

3. Chop up the garlic.

4. When the almonds feel soft, blend them in a food processor or blender with the soaked water, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, and vinegar.

5. Blend until creamy, with no large almond pieces.

6. Add the capers and blend for another 5 seconds.

7. Chill the dressing until ready to eat.

8. Serve a couple of tablespoons of the dressing over your favorite lettuce with homemade croutons.

## Modifications

Pickled items are near the olives at the store.

Use them to enhance your fridge with a jar lasting a long time.

Mix them in the House Marinara with olives and red pepper flakes for a puttanesca sauce.
