# instructions
0 chop onion and carrot
1 Make the pie crust through step 2. Let it chill out in the fridge while you make the filling. Also, start cranking your oven to 425°F while you are at it. Decide if you’re using a 9-inch pie pan or individual ramekins that hold about 2 cup to bake this shit. Get whatever you are going to use out and set it to the side.
2 To make the filling: In a medium saucepan, heat up the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it starts looking golden and delicious, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the carrot and peas and keep cooking that shit for 2 more minutes so everything starts warming up. Add the salt, oregano, thyme, pepper, and garlic and cook for another 20 seconds. Whisk in the flour and stir that shit up so there aren’t any dry clumps. Whisk in the white wine and the broth slowly so that you don’t get any big chunks. Add the beans and let this simmer away for about 10 minutes, stirring this shit every couple of minutes, until it starts to thicken up. It should coat your spoon and basically start to look like pot pie filling. Add the lemon juice and fresh herbs and remove from the heat. Taste that shit and add more herbs, lemon juice, or salt based on what you’re craving. You should get about 4 cup of filling.
3 To assemble the pot pies, roll out the crust to about .25 inch thick and cut it into a round (or rounds) so it fits on the top of your pie pan or ramekins. Pour the filling into your pie pan or ramekins, grease the edge, and lay the pie crust over the filling. Use a small knife to cut a couple vents in there to let out the steam as this fucker bakes.
4 Brush the crust with a little olive oil, place the pan or ramekins on the baking sheet, and throw it in the oven until the crust looks done, 20 to 30 minutes.
5 Let this cool for a couple minutes before serving because this comes out of the oven hotter than uptown funk.

# modifications

Feel free to drink the rest SLOWLY while you cook yourself something nice. You deserve that shit. No wine for you? Just add .5 cup vegetable broth to the pot instead.
 One 15-ounce can of beans, drained and rinsed, will work just fine.
 You can do 2 TBL chives and no parsley or all parsley and no chives. Use whatever the fuck you’ve got.
