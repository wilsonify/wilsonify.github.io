<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Make the ranchero sauce: In a medium saucepan, warm up the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook them all up until the onion starts to look a little brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the jalapeños, garlic, cumin, and salt and sauté all that delicious shit around for another minute. Add the broth and tomato sauce and let that all simmer together until it starts to thicken up a little bit, 20 to 30 minutes. Like it will look more like a sauce and less like a bunch of fucking water, you know? Add the cilantro and lime juice and turn off the heat. Taste and add more garlic, cumin, lime juice, salt, whatever you think it’s missing. Leave this motherfucker covered on the stovetop while you’re making the rest of the enchiladas, or stick it in the fridge and use it up sometime that week. This should make about 3 cup.<br>2 To make the filling: Throw .5 cup of the ranchero sauce you just made into a blender or food processer. Add the onion, garlic, beans, cumin, and salt and run that shit until it all looks kinda smooth like bean dip. Pour that into a bowl and stir in the corn. Yeah, it looks all kinds of gross, but fucking move past it because it’s going in enchiladas so you won't fucking see it. In a separate bowl, mash together the avocado and lime juice until you get it kinda smooth too. Done.<br>3 Now you’re finally going to make the fucking enchiladas. Crank your oven up to 375°F. Grab a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.<br>4 Cover the bottom of the dish with about 1.5 cup of ranchero sauce. Using a griddle, your oven, or the microwave, warm up the tortillas. Kinda dip the tortilla around in a little of the sauce in the dish so that the bottom side is all coated. Add a couple of spoonfuls of the bean corn filling in a line in the middle of the tortilla, throw some of the mashed avocado over the top, roll it up, and set it seam side down in the baking dish. You fucking know how enchiladas are supposed to look, so just do that shit. Keep going until you run out of space or out of filling.<br>5 Cover the enchiladas with the remaining ranchero sauce, cover the dish tightly with foil, and throw it in the oven for 20 minutes. Take off the foil and cook it for 5 more. Let it cool for a minute or two before serving.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>If you know your mouth is weak as shit, leave the jalapeños out or just use one.<br> Not jarred pasta sauce . . . canned unseasoned tomato sauce. Try to get one low in sodium if you can. (Unintended can joke. Just chuckle softly to yourself and get back to cooking, goddammit.)<br> Yeah, just grab two 15-ounce cans of beans. We know what you’re about. Just drain and rinse them.</p></div></div>
