# Baked Rice and Leek Cakes

#### Yields 24 Cakes, Enough for 6 to 8 People

## Ingredients
- 12 ounces extra-firm silken tofu
- 1 TBL rice vinegar
- 1 TBL toasted sesame oil
- 1 TBL soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tsp neutral oil, such as grapeseed
- 2 cups diced leeks
- 1/2 cup minced chives or green onions
- 1 TBL minced fresh ginger
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 1/2 cups cooked short-grain white or brown rice
- 1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs
- Spray oil
- Sweet Sesame Teriyaki-Style Sauce

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 425°F. Set a baking sheet aside.
2. In a blender or food processor, combine tofu, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce or tamari. Blend until smooth.
3. In a large wok or skillet, heat the grapeseed oil over medium heat. Add leeks and cook until slightly translucent, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add chives, ginger, and garlic; cook for another minute. Remove from heat.
4. Add the tofu mixture and cooked rice to the pan with the leeks. Mix well. Add 0.25 cup of panko and mix until everything is combined without any pockets of rice.
5. To make the cakes, pour the remaining 1 cup of panko onto a plate. Take about a golf ball’s worth of filling and press it into a patty shape. Coat the patty with panko by gently pressing it into the crumbs, then place it on the baking sheet.
6. Repeat until all patties are formed. Spray them lightly with oil and bake, turning halfway, until both sides are golden, about 30 minutes. Serve with the dipping sauce on the side.

## Modifications
- Refer to House Rules.
- You can use leftover or freshly made rice; the choice doesn't matter. If you're unsure how to make rice at home, Minute Rice is an option.
