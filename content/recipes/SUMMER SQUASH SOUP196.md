# SUMMER SQUASH SOUP



## ingredients
* 1 1/2 TBL olive oil 
* 0.5 onion 
* 2 ribs celery 
* 1 carrot, sliced into thin half-moons 
* 1 russet potato 
* 3 large yellow squash, sliced into half-moons .125 inch thick 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 4 cup vegetable broth 
* 1/3 cup sliced chives or green onions 



## Instructions
0 chop onion, celery, potato into dice-size cubes

1 In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and carrot and

saut√© until they begin to look a little golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the potato, squash, and

garlic and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the salt and veggie broth and bring it to a simmer.

Cook until the potato is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

2 Turn off the heat. Use an immersion blender and blend until that son of a bitch looks nice

and creamy and without a ton of chunks. (You could also pour it into a regular blender and do

it that way. Just return the blended soup to the pot.) Bring it back up to a simmer. Turn off

the heat, add the chives, and then taste. Add more salt, garlic, chives, your favorite shit. Serve

right away.
