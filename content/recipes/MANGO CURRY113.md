# instructions
0 chop onion and bell pepper
1 Grab a medium soup pot and heat the oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until
lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Add the green beans, zucchini, and bell pepper and cook until
the vegetables begin to soften up, another 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, and curry
paste and cook for another 30 seconds. Huff in that goddamn delicious smell. Add the soy
sauce, coconut milk, and vegetable broth and turn that son of a bitch to a gentle simmer.
2 Once the pot is gently simmering, add the mango and tofu. Reduce the heat to low and let
this all cook together until the mango is tender enough to fall apart, 5 to 8 minutes. Turn off
the heat, add the lime juice, and then dish up. Serve over the brown rice and tell your neighbors
to fucking go home when they stop by asking what smells so good.

You can find this in a glass jar or small can shelved near the coconut milk and soy sauces. It’s made of all kinds
of shit like shallots, lemongrass, galangal, and red chiles. Some pastes are hotter than others, so try 1 TBL
first and then work your way up in the recipe. There are hundreds of recipes for making this shit yourself, so if you
have a well-stocked store, look a recipe up and make this fucker from scratch. The hardest part is finding all the
ingredients, trust.
