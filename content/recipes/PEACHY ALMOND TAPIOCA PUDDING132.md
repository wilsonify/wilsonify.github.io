# Peachy Almond Tapioca Pudding

#### Yields: 4 servings

## Ingredients
- 2 cups water  
- 1 cup small pearl tapioca  
- 2 cups peach juice (or peach-apple juice)  
- 2 cups almond milk  
- Pinch of salt  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 2–3 tbsp agave nectar (optional, depending on juice sweetness)  
- 1 tbsp lemon juice  
- Fresh blueberries, for topping  

## Instructions

1. **Soak the tapioca**  
   Place the tapioca pearls in a bowl and cover with the water. Let soak for 12–16 hours (no more than 16, or the texture gets odd). Drain before cooking.  

2. **Cook the pudding**  
   Add the drained tapioca pearls to a medium saucepan along with the peach juice, almond milk, salt, and vanilla. If your juice isn’t very sweet, stir in agave to taste.  
   Warm over low heat, stirring constantly. Do not let it boil. After 8–10 minutes the mixture should start to thicken and the pearls should look more translucent. Continue stirring until the consistency is like a thick soup or gravy, about 1 more minute.  
   Remove from heat, stir in the lemon juice, and transfer to a medium bowl. Refrigerate until cool.  

3. **Chill and serve**  
   Let the pudding chill for 3–4 hours before serving. If it thickens too much in the fridge, stir in an extra tablespoon of peach juice. Top with fresh blueberries before serving.  

## Modifications
- Tapioca pearls are usually sold in bags in the baking aisle or online. Don’t skip them—they’re essential for thickening.  
- You can substitute other juices, but avoid highly acidic ones like orange. Peach-apple juice works especially well.
