# BBQ BEAN BURRITOS WITH GRILLED PEACH SALSA


     

     






#### yields  6 BIG-ASS BURRITOS


## ingredients
* 3 TBL tomato paste 
* 3 to 4 clove garlic 
* 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce plus 1 TBL of the sauce 
* 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water 
* 2 TBL orange juice 
* 2 TBL light brown sugar 
* 1 TBL molasses 
* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 3 cup cooked pinto beans 
* 6 flour tortillas 
* Baked Spanish Rice 
* Shredded lettuce 
* Grilled Peach Salsa 
* Sliced avocado 



## Instructions
1 First, make the BBQ beans: Throw the onion, tomato paste, garlic, chipotle peppers and

sauce, broth, OJ, brown sugar, molasses, and soy sauce in a food processor or blender and run

that fucker until a smooth sauce forms. Pour that into a medium saucepan over medium-low

heat, fold in the beans, and simmer until everything is warm and the beans absorb all that

flavor, 5 to 10 minutes.

2 To make the burritos: Grab your tortilla and pile in a scoop of the beans, some rice, and a

handful of lettuce and top with the peach salsa and some avocado. Serve right away because

burritos wait for no motherfucker.



## Modifications
These smoked peppers come packed in sauce and are sold in a tiny can at most stores near the salsa and beans.

Trust us, it’s there, just fucking look before you start whining.

 Two 15-ounce cans if you aren’t cooking this shit yourself
