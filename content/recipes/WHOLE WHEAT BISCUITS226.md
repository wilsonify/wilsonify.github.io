<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Crank your oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with some parchment paper.<br>2 Mix together the milk and vinegar in a small glass and set it out of the way for a minute.<br>3 Sift the flours, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Crumble the oil<br>into the flour a TBL at a time using your fingers and break up into pieces a little bigger<br>than a pea. It should look kinda like coarse sand from a shitty playground, minus the broken<br>glass. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk mixture. Stir until a shaggy dough is<br>formed, but be careful not to over-mix because then you will have some tough biscuits. If it is<br>too dry to stick together, add a TBL or two of milk.<br>4 Turn the dough out on a floured surface and pat it into a roughly 8 x 5-inch rectangle about<br>1.5 inches thick. using the open end of a glass or biscuit cutter, cut out all the motherfucking<br>biscuits you can and put them on the baking sheet. You should end up with about 8.<br>5 Bake the biscuits until the bottoms are golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Let them cool for a<br>minute before digging in or go ahead and start the day by burning the fuck out of your taste<br>buds, you dumbass.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>flour is really similar to all-purpose flour in texture and taste but contains all the good bran<br>and germ stuff like you find in whole wheat flour. Basically, it is the shit. If you can’t find it, use whole wheat or<br>all-purpose instead.<br> Yeah, don’t bitch. In the quest for a fluffy biscuit, it had to be done.<br> This needs to be all opaque and solid like butter. If it is clear and runny because it is hot outside, this won’t<br>fucking work. Stick it in the fridge until it gets its act together.</p></div></div>
