# COCONUT-LIME RICE WITH RED BEANS AND MANGO
#### yields 4 TO 6 AS A SIDE
## ingredients
* 2 cup short-grain brown rice

* 2 tsp neutral-tasting oil

* 1 cup diced shallots or onion

* 1 1/2 TBL minced fresh ginger

* 1 cup canned coconut milk

* 2 1/2 cup vegetable broth

* 1/4 tsp salt

* 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

* 1 mango

* 1 1/2 cup cooked red beans
<>
* tsp lime juice

cilantro or green onions, for serving

# instructions
1 Rinse the rice under cool water. Heat up the oil over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add
the shallots and sauté until they start to brown in some spots, about 3 minutes. Add the
ginger and sauté for 30 seconds until everything smells choice. Add the rice and keep stirring
until the rice starts to smell slightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk, broth,
salt, and cayenne pepper and bring to a simmer. Give the pot a quick stir, cover it, and reduce
the heat to low. Keep it all at a very gentle simmer and leave it the fuck alone until the rice is
tender and has absorbed nearly all the liquid, about 40 minutes. If your rice isn’t done by the
time you run out of liquid, don’t stress that shit; just add a little more broth or water.
2 While the rice is cooking, chop up the mango into bite-size pieces. (Not sure how to chop
that fucker up? Turn to this page for the how-to. You should get around 1.5 cup of flesh
from 1 mango.)
3 When the rice is tender, fold in the beans, lime zest, lime juice, and mango. Let this all cook
together for another minute or two so that everything is warmed up. Serve warm topped with
cilantro or green onions.

# modifications

Grapeseed, peanut, or regular sesame oil work fucking great.
 That’s about 4 shallots or .5 small onion.
 See Dropping Knowledge.
 Leave this shit out if you can’t stand the heat.
 Or two 15-ounce cans. Also, you can use black or kidney beans here if you can’t find red beans.
