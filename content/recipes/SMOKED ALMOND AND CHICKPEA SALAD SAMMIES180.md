# instructions
1 Heat your oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
2 To make the almonds: Mix together all the liquid ingredients in a small bowl and combine
the nutritional yeast, paprika, and garlic powder in a separate bowl. Grab the almonds, add
them to the liquid bowl, and stir that together to make sure all the almonds are covered. Scoop
out the almonds, add them to the bowl with all the dry seasonings, and stir that    around
until they are covered. When they look all seasoned, scoop them out and lay them on the
baking sheet. Toast them in the oven for 10 minutes, stir them around, and then put them
back in the oven for 5 more minutes. Take them out and let those sons of   cool.
3 While all that    is happening, add the chickpeas, avocado, and lemon juice to a big bowl
and mash the   out of them. Some chunks are fine, whatever you like. Fold in the onion, dill,
celery, hot sauce, salt, and pepper, then mix it all together.
4 Once the almonds have cooled, chop them up and add them to the bowl.
5 Serve up this badass filling on some toasted bread with Dijon mustard, lettuce, and tomato.
This is best enjoyed the day it’s made; it keeps fine in the fridge but you might lose some of
that crunch.
