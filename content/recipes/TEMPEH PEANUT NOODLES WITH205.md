# TEMPEH PEANUT NOODLES WITH



#### yields  4


## ingredients
* 2 tsp toasted sesame oil 
* 2 tsp lime juice 
* 2 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 tsp maple syrup or agave syrup 
* 1 tsp chili-garlic paste or Asian-style hot sauce (optional)
* 12 ounces noodles 
* 6 cup kale, sliced into bite-size pieces 
* 1 tsp grapeseed oil 
* 8 ounces tempeh 
* 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 TBL rice vinegar 
* 2 TBL minced fresh ginger 
* 3 clove garlic 
* 1/2 cup sliced green onions 



## Instructions
1 First make the peanut sauce. In a medium glass, whisk together the peanut butter and water

until it looks all creamy. Add all the other ingredients and keep stirring until everything is

incorporated. Simple shit.

2 Now cook the noodles according to the package directions, but use a larger soup pot than

usual. In the last 30 seconds of cooking the noodles, add the kale to the pot and stir it into the

water to make sure it’s all covered. After 30 seconds, drain the pasta and kale and run it under

cold water to stop the cooking process and keep the kale green. That’s called lazy-ass

blanching. Some people might say to do that shit in separate pots, but those are usually the

motherfuckers who don’t wash their own dishes, so fuck them.

3 Grab a big wok or skillet and heat up the oil. Crumble in the tempeh in bite-size pieces and

sauté it around until it starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, ginger,

and garlic and cook it for 30 seconds more. Turn off the heat and add the noodles and three-

quarters of the peanut sauce. Mix it all up to make sure everything is covered and that the

tempeh is blended into the noodles. Taste it and if it isn’t saucy enough for you, add the rest of

the sauce now. Otherwise, hold on to that shit because the noodles really absorb the sauce as

they sit, so it’s nice to have extra for leftovers. Top with the green onions and serve warm or at

room temperature.



## Modifications
Don’t buy peanut butter that has anything other than peanuts, a little oil, and salt listed as ingredients.

Anything else is unfuckingnecessary.

 Optional, but you should suck it up and do it.

 Soba, udon, spaghetti, whatthefuckever.
