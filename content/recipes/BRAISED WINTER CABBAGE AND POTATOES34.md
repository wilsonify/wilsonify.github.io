<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Heat your oven to 350°F.<br>2 Chop the cabbage in half and slice into wedges no thicker than 2 inches. If it has an extra<br>thick core, chop that fucker right out. Roughly chop the onion and carrots. Big chunks are<br>fine because they are going to have time to cook all the way through.<br>3 Grab a 9 x 13-inch baking dish and lay the cabbage pieces all down in one layer. Throw the<br>chopped onion and carrots all around them and then pour in the broth and oil. Cover with foil<br>and stick in the oven for 40 minutes.<br>4 While that cabbage business is braising, slice the small potatoes in half. You want chunks<br>about the size of the head of a soup spoon. When 40 minutes have gone by, take the cabbage<br>out of the oven and turn the wedges over. Next, add the potatoes all over those motherfuckers<br>and sprinkle in the garlic, rosemary, and .25 tsp salt. Stir the potatoes around so that they<br>kinda get some of the remaining broth on them, but don’t spend a lot of time on this. It’s not<br>worth a bunch of trouble. Cover that fucker back up and let it bake for 40 more minutes, then<br>take off the foil, and let it go for 10 more minutes.<br>5 When all that time has passed, take that heavy-ass dish out of the oven, drizzle the lemon<br>juice over it, and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm. Some vinegary hot sauce on those<br>potatoes wouldn’t be the worst idea.</p></div></div></div>
