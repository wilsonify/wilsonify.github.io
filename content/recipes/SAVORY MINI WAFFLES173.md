# SAVORY MINI WAFFLES



#### yields  12 MINI WAFFLES, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU POUR THAT   


## ingredients
* 2 1/4 cup unsweetened nondairy milk (your favorite) 
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice 
* 1 1/2 cup finely ground cornmeal 
* 1 cup all-purpose or whole wheat flour 
* 2 TBL nutritional yeast 
* 1 TBL baking powder 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* Smoky onions (from Cobb Salad) 
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 2 TBL minced chives or green onions 
* Spray oil 
* Roasted Garlic Dip 



## Instructions
1 Warm up the waffle iron.

2 In a small bowl, mix together the milk and vinegar and set aside.

3 In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, nutritional yeast, baking powder, and salt so that they are all mixed.

4 Stir the smoky onions into the milk mixture. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the milk/onion stuff and the oil. Whisk everything together a couple times and then add the chives. Stir a few more times until the chives are all mixed in, there aren’t any dry spots, and only a few lumps.

5 Spray the warmed-up waffle iron with some oil so those bitches won’t stick, then pour in about .25 cup of the batter for each waffle section on your iron. Cook until golden brown according to your waffle maker’s directions. Serve warm with the dipping sauce.



## Modifications
Same    that you’d use to make cornbread, not polenta.

 WTF?
