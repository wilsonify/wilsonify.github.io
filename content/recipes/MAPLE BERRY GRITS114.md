# MAPLE BERRY GRITS
#### yields  4 DAYS

## ingredients
* 2 cup water
* 2 cup almond or other nondairy milk
* 1 cup stoneground grits
* ¼-½ tsp salt
* 1-2 tsp maple syrup
* jam
* Fresh berries


# instructions
1 Grab a medium saucepan and bring the water and milk to a boil over medium heat. Gently
whisk in the grits and .25 tsp salt. Don’t just dump it all in and spill water everywhere—
show some fucking care, man. Bring it all to a boil and then reduce that heat to low. Cover the
pot and then let that deliciousness simmer for 20 minutes. Stir the fucker on occasion while
you sip your coffee and troll the Internet, ’cause you don’t want anything sticking to the
bottom.
2 When the grits have absorbed most of the liquid and are tender, turn that flame off and add
1 tsp of maple syrup. Taste and add the rest of the salt and syrup if you think it needs it.
That’s on you. Serve with a small scoop of your favorite jam on top and some fresh berries so it
looks all classy as fuck.
