Southern Baked Beans
===

Yield: 8 cups, 8 Servings

Time: 12 hours soaking, 1 hour cooking, 10 mins active, 

# Ingredients

1 pound dried navy beans or other white beans, soaked overnight and drained
4 cups water
1 medium yellow or white onion (8 ounces), chopped
1/4 cup liquid aminos, such as Bragg’s, plus more to taste
2 tablespoons tomato paste, preferably double concentrated
1 teaspoon Spanish smoked paprika (pimenton)
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon mustard powder
Fine salt


# Instructions


    Step 1

    In a 6-quart Instant Pot or other multicooker, combine the beans with the water, onion, aminos, tomato paste, smoked paprika, black pepper and mustard.
    Step 2

    Secure the lid on the pot and close the pressure valve. Select PRESSURE (HIGH) and set to 30 minutes. (It takes about 10 minutes for the appliance to come to pressure before cooking begins.) Once cooking is complete, cover your hand with a towel or hot pad and release the pressure manually by moving the pressure-release handle to “Venting.” Never put your hands or face near the vent when it's releasing steam.
    Step 3

    Taste the broth, and season with more aminos and/or salt, if needed. Serve hot.

Substitutions

No navy beans? >> Use cannellini, Great Northern, cranberry/borlotti or pinto. Liquid aminos >> coconut aminos, low-sodium tamari or soy sauce.
Variations

To bake these instead, position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 250 degrees. Bring the beans and water to a boil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat, then lower the heat and simmer the beans gently for 15 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients except for the salt, cover and bake for about 3 hours, or until the beans are very tender and fragrant. (Check inside the pot from time to time, and if the liquid has reduced so it is no longer covering the beans, add boiling water to barely cover and continue cooking.) Taste, and season with more aminos and/or salt if needed.
