# FRESH CORN BUTTER PIE
#### yields 1 PIE
## ingredients
* 3 cup corn kernels* 3 cup corn kernelst* 3 cup corn kernels* 3 cup corn kernels* 3 cup corn kernelsextract

* 1/4 tsp salt
Whipped Cream *optional*

# instructions
0 cut corn kernels off the cob.
1 Make the pie crust through step 3. Let it chill out in the fridge while you make the filling. Also, start cranking your oven up to 425°F.
2 Make the filling: In a blender, throw the corn, milk, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt all together and run that motherfucker for a minute or two to get all the fiber from the corn to break down. You shouldn’t have to go for more than a minute and a half if you have a decent blender. You know what kind of garbage shit you are working with, not us.
3 On a well floured surface, roll out your pie dough and press it into a 9-inch pie pan. Cut off any extra hanging over the edges and press the edge of the crust into a pattern: Pinch it around your pointer finger or make a pattern with a fork. Whatever.
4 Pour that filling right into the pie shell and stick it in the oven. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and bake that fucker until the crust is golden and the center doesn’t look all wet and wobbly if you shake the pie a little, 35 to 45 minutes.
5 Let it cool for at least 1 hour before serving. This pie is great kinda warmish but also tasty as hell if you let it chill overnight and serve it cold. Top it with whipped cream if you want to get fancy.

# modifications

About 4 large ears of corn. The filling sets so much better if you use fresh corn kernels. If it worked well with frozen, we promise we would tell you that shit.
