# Butter Beans Recipe

## Ingredients

- **Olive oil:** Olive oil is used to extract the garlic’s flavor and toast the herbs, making them more intense. Use a high quality, extra virgin variety. Any of the hand selected olive oils from our shop work well with this recipe.
- **Garlic:** A healthy amount of garlic adds a bold flavor to the beans.
- **Spices:** Red pepper flakes, Urfa pepper, cumin, and smoked paprika give these butter beans a Mediterranean twist. Kosher salt and black pepper enhance the flavor. Note: Urfa pepper is a Turkish spice that adds a slightly earthy heat. You can substitute with Aleppo pepper, more red chili flakes, or simply leave it out if you’d like.
- **Butter beans:** Large, creamy beans that are delicious right out of the can but even better with a quick simmer. You can substitute with any large white bean, like cannelini or Great Northern.
- **Lemon:** Fresh lemon juice lightens the richness of the beans, perfectly complementing the fresh herbs and garlic. Fresh lime juice would also work.
- **Green onions:** Used like an herb, green onion is mild enough to enjoy raw. They add a fresh sweet and savory flavor that complements the stewed garlic. You can substitute with shallots or chives if you’d like.
- **Fresh herbs:** Parsley and dill add a Mediterranean spirit and freshness to the butter beans. Any tender, leafy herb like basil or mint would also work.

## Instructions

### 1. Toast the seasonings.
- Mince 4 garlic cloves. In a large nonstick pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
- When the oil begins to shimmer, add the minced garlic, ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika, and ½ teaspoon each of red pepper flakes, Urfa biber (if using), and cumin.
- Season with a big pinch of salt and pepper and stir just until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (do not let the garlic brown or the oil will taste bitter).

### 2. Simmer the beans.
- Add 2 (15-ounce) cans of drained butter beans and 1 cup of vegetable broth.
- Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer until the beans are warm and the broth is just slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, trim and chop 2 green onions. Prepare ⅓ cup each of chopped dill and parsley.

### 3. Finish and serve.
- Juice in two lemons, then stir in 2 chopped green onions and fresh herbs.
- Serve warm.
