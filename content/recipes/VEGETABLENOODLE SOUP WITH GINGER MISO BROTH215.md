# VEGETABLE-NOODLE SOUP WITH GINGER MISO BROTH



#### yields  2 BIG-ASS BOWLS OR 4 SIDES


## ingredients
* 4 inches fresh ginger 
* 2 big clove garlic 
* 1 carrot 
* 6 cup vegetable broth or water 
* 10 sprigs cilantro 
* 8 ounces soba, udon, or rice noodles 
* 1/4 tsp soy sauce or tamari 
* 1 1/4 cup broccoli cut into bite-size pieces 
* 1 1/2 tsp red miso paste 
* 1 carrot, cut into thin matchsticks 
* 1 cup snow peas cut into matchsticks 
* 1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions 
* Your favorite condiments 



## Instructions
1 To make the broth, peel the ginger by scraping the skin off with a spoon. Cut the ginger

into .25-inch-thick slices. Thickly slice the garlic too and chop the carrot into big chunks. Grab

a medium pot and turn the heat on to medium. Once the pot is hot, add the ginger and carrot

chunks and let those  ers go on the bottom of the pot with no oil or anything. Keep

stirring them around off and on for 2 minutes. Itâ€™s cool if they stick, just rip them off with the

spoon and keep going. Now add the garlic and do the same    for another minute. Pour in

the broth or water, add the cilantro, and let that veggie hot tub simmer for 15 minutes.

2 While the broth is doing its thing, cook the noodles according to the package directions.

3 When the broth has simmered 15 minutes, pull out all the ginger, garlic, carrot, and cilantro

with a slotted spoon. Add the soy sauce and broccoli and simmer for a minute or two until the

broccoli has lost its raw edge, then turn off the heat. Scoop up .5 cup of the broth and dissolve

the miso paste in it, stirring until the chunks are gone. Pour that back in the pot and give it all

a taste.  great, right?

4 To assemble, grab a handful of the noodles and place them at the bottom of a bowl. Add a

handful of the carrots, snow peas, and green onions. Ladle the hot broth and broccoli bits over

and let it sit for a minute as the carrots and snow peas soften. Top with some more of the

green onions and some of your favorite condiments.



## Modifications
Stems and all,  .

 WTF? See tip.

 A squeeze of lime juice, a dash of toasted sesame oil, and a splooge of Sriracha are usually the way to go for

condiments, but you do you.
