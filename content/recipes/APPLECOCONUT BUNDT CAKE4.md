# Apple-Coconut Bundt Cake

#### Yields 1 Cake, Enough for 6 to 8 People

## Ingredients
- 1 lb apples
- 2 TBL plus 3 cups whole wheat pastry or all-purpose flour
- 1 can (14 ounces) coconut milk, about 1.5 cups
- 2/3 cup unsweetened plain milk
- 2 TBL grapeseed or olive oil
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 TBL apple cider vinegar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/8 tsp ground clove or cardamom
- 1 cup finely shredded unsweetened coconut
- Powdered sugar
- Whipped cream

## Instructions

1. Peel and core apples, cut into small cubes no larger than a dime (about 3 cups).

2. Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Grease and flour a Bundt pan and set it aside.

3. In a large measuring cup, toss the cubed apples with 2 TBL of flour until coated. Set aside.

4. In a large bowl, stir together the milks, oil, sugars, extract, and vinegar until well mixed.

5. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices. Pour half the flour mixture into the milk mixture and stir until no large dry spots remain. Add the second half and repeat. Gently fold in the apples and coconut. The batter will be thick.

6. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly. If using a detailed Bundt pan, let it sit for a couple of minutes to settle into the detailing.

7. Bake on the middle rack until a toothpick inserted in multiple areas comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert it onto a plate. Let it cool completely.

8. Serve with a light dusting of powdered sugar and whipped cream. (Or with a side of yogurt for breakfast.)

## Modifications

Any crisp apples you enjoy eating will work well.

If you can't find ground clove or cardamom, substitute the same amount of cinnamon.

If you don't have a Bundt pan, thrift stores often have one. 

use an angel food cake pan, ensuring there's a hole in the center for the talking circle effect.
