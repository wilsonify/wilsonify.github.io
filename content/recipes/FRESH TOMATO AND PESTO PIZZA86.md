# FRESH TOMATO AND PESTO PIZZA
#### yields  2 INDIVIDUAL PIZZAS

## ingredients
* 2 ½ cup packed torn basil leaves
* 2/3 cup slivered or sliced almonds
* ¼ cup olive oil
* ¼ cup water
* ¾ tsp grated lemon zest
* 2 TBL lemon juice
* ½ tsp salt
* 2 to 3 clove garlic
* Roasted Garlic White Sauce
* 2 large tomatoes, sliced into thin half-moons
* Olive oil, for brushing the crust

# instructions
0 chop garlic
1 Make the pizza dough through step 4. Start cranking up the oven to 475°F. Yeah, you’re using that hot hot heat.
2 While that yeasty beast is rising, make the pesto: Put all the ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend until smooth-ish. Scrape the pesto out of the processor. (No food processor? Don’t give up, adapt and improvise, mother er. Just put the almonds in a plastic bag and smash them until they’re tiny and chop the rest of that    up supersmall too. Mix all of it together with a fork until it looks like a paste.) Set the pesto aside.
3 After you make the pesto, rinse the processor or blender out and use it to make the roasted garlic sauce. Easy   .
4 Roll out one ball of the dough using the instructions. Spread about .25 cup of the roasted garlic sauce down over your dough, and then smear a good amount of pesto over that   , leaving about 1 inch around the edges as the crust. Lay down the tomato slices all over that and drizzle some roasted garlic sauce over the top. Repeat that    with the second ball of dough.
5 Brush the crusts with olive oil, put that    on a baking sheet, and bake until the crusts look golden, 10 to 12 minutes. If you have extra pesto, dollop some of that    on top before serving.
6 Serve hot, with some hot sauce on the side if you like a little fire on your ’za.
