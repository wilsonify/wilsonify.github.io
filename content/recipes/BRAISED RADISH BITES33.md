		<instructions>1 Radishes are dirty little fuckers, so make sure to rinse the hell outta them before you get cooking. Trim off the greens from the radishes and slice the globes into halves if they’re about the size of Ping-Pong balls and into quarters if they’re big as fuck.
2 In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and sauté until they start to look brownish, about 5 minutes. Add the radishes to the pan with a cut side facing down. Cook the radishes without touching them for about 5 minutes. I know you wanna fuck with them, but just let them chill. After 5 minutes, add the water, vinegar, and salt.
3 Cover the pan and let the radishes continue to cook until the liquid has evaporated from the pan and the radishes are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. No lid for the pan? Just cover it with some foil. Garnish with some parsley, if you like, and serve up.</instructions>
