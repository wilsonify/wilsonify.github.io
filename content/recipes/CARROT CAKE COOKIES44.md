# CARROT CAKE COOKIES



#### yields  20 COOKIES


## ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup flour (whole wheat pastry or white) 
* 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 
* 1 tsp baking powder 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger 
* 1 cup shredded carrots 
* 1/2 cup plain almond or other nondairy milk 
* 1/4 cup olive or grapeseed oil 
* 1/2 cup walnuts 
* 1/2 cup raisins or chopped candied ginger 



## Instructions
1 Heat your oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2 In a large bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and

ground ginger. Make sure there are no lumps of brown sugar hanging around in there. In a

smaller bowl, mix together the shredded carrots, milk, and oil. Pour the wet ingredients into

the dry ones and stir all that shit until there are only a couple dry spots. Fold in the nuts and

raisins and stir until there aren’t any dry spots.

3 Scoop spoonfuls of the dough onto the baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Bake until the

bottoms are golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. Then do whatever the fuck you do with freshly

baked cookies.



## Modifications
That’s about 2 medium carrots on a box grater.

 This shit is optional. These cookies are just as dope without them, too.
