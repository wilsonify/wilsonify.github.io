# LOADED NACHOS

#### yields  enough for 4 TO 6 PEOPLE
* 4 to 5 handfuls warm tortilla chips
* 1 ½ cup cooked black beans
* 1 cup thinly sliced cabbage or romaine lettuce
* Butternut Squash Queso-ish Dip
* Everyday Guacamole
* Your favorite chunky-style salsa
* 1 jalapeño, sliced into thin circles
* ¼ cup cilantro
* Hot sauce (Optional)


## Instructions
1 You know how nachos work, so you can pile this    on however you like and leave off or add whatever the   you want. We like to put the warm chips out in a thin layer on a tray or giant plate. A huge pile of chips where you end up with a   -ton of dry chips at the bottom is a  bummer. Thin layer is the way to go.

2 Scatter the black beans and cabbage over that, then drizzle the queso all over the chips. Glob on nice spoonfuls of guacamole and salsa all over the platter then sprinkle with the jalapeño and cilantro. Drizzle over some hot sauce if you roll like that.

3 Serve that    right up to the happy crowd.



## Modifications
Warming not required, but this shows commitment to the nacho cause. Just throw the chips in a microwave for a few seconds, or cover and put in a 250°F oven for 10 minutes.

 Or a 15-ounce can of beans, rinsed and drained.

 The Mid-Summer Salsa from our first book would be dope here.
