# SPRING VEGGIE BOWL WITH RED CURRY LIME SAUCE

#### yields  4 TO 6 BOWLS

## ingredients

## Instructions


1 Cook the noodles according to the package directions. When theyâ€™re all done, drain them,

run them under cool water for a sec, and then set them aside. We will need these fuckers later.

2 Next, make the Red Curry Lime Sauce.

3 Brush the baby bok choy with 1 TBL of the oil and toss the asparagus with the other

1 TBL. Now heat up your grill or grill pan to medium-high and lightly grease it up with

a thin layer of oil. Throw on the asparagus and grill those pointy fuckers until all the sides have

some grill marks and the stalk has a little give when you pick it up with your tongs, 5 to 8

minutes with periodic rotation. Next, add the bok choy and cook on each side for 3 to 4

minutes so that they pick up some nice grill marks. When the veggies are done, squeeze the

lime juice over them and add a sprinkle of salt. When the bok choy is cool enough to handle,

cut each piece in half one more time from top to bottom so that shit is easier to eat. Cut the

asparagus into 1-inch pieces for the same fucking reason.

4 Now throw together your bowls. Start by placing a handful of the noodles (about 1 cup) on

one side of the bottom of your bowl. On the other two-thirds of the bowl, pile in a bunch of

the grilled veggies and tofu strips. Drizzle the whole fucking thing with the sauce, top with the

green onions, and serve right away.
