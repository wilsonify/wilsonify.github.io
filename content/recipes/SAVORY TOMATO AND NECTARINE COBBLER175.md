# instructions
1 Crank up the oven to 375°F. Grab a 9 x 13-inch or similar-size baking dish.
2 Chop the nectarines up into pieces about the size of a dime and throw them into a medium bowl. You want about 2 cup. Keep that skin on unless you hate flavor, fiber, and yourself, because those fuckers are hard to peel. If your tomatoes are smaller than a dime, you can keep those fuckers whole; otherwise halve them and toss in with the nectarines. Toss them all together with the cornstarch and let it sit for a sec.
3 In a skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it looks golden, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the garlic and nectarine/tomato mixture. Fold in the basil, vinegar, and salt and mix until everything is coated. Toss that into your baking dish and put it all in the oven for 15 minutes while you make the topping.
4 Make the cornmeal biscuit topping: In a small glass, mix up the milk and vinegar and let it sit. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Crumble the chilled butter into the flour and break into pieces smaller than a pea using a fork or pastry cutter. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk mixture. Stir until a shaggy dough is formed but be careful not to overmix because then you will have some tough biscuits. If it is too dry to stick together, add a TBL or two of milk.
5 Turn the dough out on a floured surface and pat it into a roughly 8 x 6-inch rectangle about 1.5 inches thick. Using a glass, small bowl, or biscuit cutter, cut out all the motherfucking biscuits you can. You should end up with about 8 if you push all the scraps back together and recut that shit. (If you want this shit to look rustic or you want a lazy option, just spoon that dough into big blobs all over the top of the filling. Done.)
6 After the filling has been in the oven for 15 minutes, lay the biscuits down over it (or in blobs if that’s what you’re doing). Spray the dough with some oil and stick it back in the oven until the tops of the biscuits look golden and cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes.
7 Let this fucker cool for about 5 to 10 before serving because that fruit filling is crazy-hot straight out of the oven. RIP taste buds. RIP.

# modifications

Whole wheat pastry flour is really similar to all-purpose flour in texture and taste but contains all the good bran and germ stuff like you find in whole wheat flour. Basically, it’s the shit.
 The finely ground shit you would grab to make cornbread, not the coarse stuff you’d make polenta with.
