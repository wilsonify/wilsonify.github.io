# ROASTED POTATOES WITH RED PEPPER DIPPING SAUCE



#### yields  4 PEOPLE, BUT YOU CAN DOUBLE OR TRIPLE, NO  PROBLEM


## ingredients
* small yellow or red potatoes, sliced in half 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1 TBL cornmeal 
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1 pinch salt 
* 1/4 cup chives or green onions 
* 2 roasted red bell peppers 
* 1/4 cup sliced almonds, raw or toasted 
* 2 TBL vegetable broth or water 
* 1 TBL tomato paste 
* 1 TBL sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar 
* 1 clove garlic 
* 2 tsp olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 
* 1/4 tsp salt 



## Instructions
1 Crank your oven to 425°F. Grab a rimmed baking sheet.

2 In a medium bowl, toss together the potatoes, oil, cornmeal, paprika, and salt until the potatoes are all covered a little bit. Pour them out onto the baking sheet and bake until the potatoes start looking nice and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes, stirring halfway.

3 While the potatoes are roasting, make the dip: Throw everything together in a blender or small food processor and let that run until it looks kinda smooth. Pour it into a kick-ass–looking glass or bowl and stick it in the fridge. This should make about 1 cup.

4 When the potatoes are done, dump them onto a plate with a bowl of the dipping sauce, sprinkle with the chives, and serve.



## Modifications
The kind of finely ground cornmeal you’d use to make cornbread, not gritty-ass polenta.
