* 1 large tomato, sliced

# instructions
0 chop onion
1 Grab a big bowl and throw in the beans, avocado, and lemon juice and mash the fuck out of the whole thing. Some chunks are fine, but you’re looking for a 60-40 ratio of bean paste to bean chunks. Fold in the onion, cucumber, basil, garlic, cayenne (if using), and .5 tsp salt and mix it all together.
2 In a separate bowl toss together the arugula, oil, and a pinch of salt.
3 Now assemble the sammies. Throw a handful of the arugula mix down on the bread, pile on a bunch of the white bean mixture, then top it with a couple tomato slices. Press the other piece of bread down on top, you know, like a fucking sandwich. Then eat it, like a fucking sandwich.

# modifications

Or two 15-ounce cans of beans, drained and rinsed, if you’re making this shit on the go.
 Optional, but consider yourself fucking peer-pressured.
