# CARROT DOGS



#### yields  8 DOGS, ENOUGH FOR 4 TO 8 PEOPLE


## ingredients
* 1 cup vegetable broth 
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 
* 2 TBL rice vinegar 
* 2 TBL soy sauce 
* 1/2 tsp liquid smoke 
* 1 TBL paprika 
* 2 tsp mustard powder or ground mustard seed 
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder 
* 1/2 tsp ground coriander 
* 1/4 tsp finely ground black pepper 
* 2 TBL olive oil 
* 8 medium carrots 
* 8 hotdog buns, whatever kind of shit you like 
* Topping ideas: smoky onions (from Cobb Salad), your favorite chili, dill relish, mustard, ketchup 



## Instructions
0 peel carrots and cut the length of the buns

1 In a medium saucepan, mix together the broth, vinegars, soy sauce, liquid smoke, and spices. Bring that shit to a simmer while you throw the oil and the carrots together in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Let the marinade simmer for 5 minutes, then pour it over the carrots. Cover that shit with foil and let it sit for at least 30 minutes but up to 1.5 hours.

2 When you are about ready to get these fuckers cooking, heat up your oven to 425°F.

3 Stick the carrots in the oven, still covered in foil, and cook them for 20 minutes. Then take off the foil, kinda stir them around/flip them over, and roast them for another 20 to 25 minutes. You want them to be tender on the outside with a little bit of resistance in the center when you stab one with a fork.

4 Add your choice of toppings and serve right away. Or stash them away and heat them back up on a well-oiled grill.



## Modifications
WTF?
