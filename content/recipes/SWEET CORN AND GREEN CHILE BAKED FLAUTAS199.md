		<instructions>0 Chop garlic
1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Grab a large baking sheet and coat it with a little cooking spray.
2 Heat up the oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat and throw in the onion. Cook until
the onion starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, and garlic and
cook for another 30 seconds and then turn off the heat.
3 Throw the beans, chiles, and lime juice together in a big-ass bowl. Mash them up using a
potato masher or a spoon until a paste forms. It’s cool if there are some whole beans left here
and there; you don’t need to spend the whole goddamn day mashing. Fold in the sautéed
onions and corn and stir that motherfucker up. Your filling is ready.
4 Using a griddle, your oven, or the microwave, warm up the tortillas. Grab about 2 heaping
TBL of the filling and spread that shit in a nice line toward the edge of the left side of
one of the tortillas from top to bottom. Then roll that shit up nice and tight from left to
right. You could even put a small smear of beans toward the other end of the tortilla to help
that fucker stay shut. Place the flauta seam side down on the baking sheet about an inch or two
away from its flauta brethren. Make sure the filling got all the way to the ends and then adjust
how you distribute the filling the next time. Damn. Keep going until you run out of tortillas
or filling.
5 Lightly coat them all with cooking spray and bake for 10 minutes. When you pull them out,
the bottoms should be golden—if not, stick them in for another couple minutes. When the
bottoms look good, turn them over and bake those bitches until they’re golden and crispy on
both sides, another 5 to 7 minutes. Serve warm topped with lettuce and salsa if you want to
impress some motherfuckers.</instructions>
		<modifications>These should be in a tiny can near the salsa in your grocery store. If you can’t find them, you can roast 2
poblano peppers following the method for bell peppers on this page.
 This is about 1 cob’s worth. That’s a fucking ridiculous phrase but whatever. You can use frozen if that’s all you
can find.</modifications>
