# CORN AND BASIL CHOWDER



#### yields  4 TO 6 AS A SIDE


## ingredients
* 6 large ears corn, shucked <iv itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 First you want to use a sharp knife to cut the corn off of the cobs. It’s easier if you snap the

cob in half, stand it on its end in the middle of a large bowl and cut the kernels off from top to

bottom. When you’re all done, you should have about 4 cup of kernels. Don’t get lazy and use

frozen corn here; that shit will not taste the same. Chop the onion, celery, bell pepper, and

potato into bean-size pieces and mince the garlic. Prep work done.

2 Now grab a large soup pot and heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until

it browns lightly, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, bell pepper, potato, and garlic and cook for

about 2 more minutes. Add the salt and then three-quarters of the corn kernels and stir. Add

the broth and let that son of a bitch simmer until the potato pieces are soft, about 10 minutes.

3 When the potato is soft, turn off the heat. Use an immersion blender and blend until that

motherfucker looks nice and creamy and without a bunch of chunks. (You could also pour it

into your blender and do it that way; up to you. Just return the blended soup to the pot.) Add

the rest of the corn and the lemon juice, and bring it back to a simmer. Turn off the heat, add

the basil, and then taste. Add more salt, more lemon juice, more basil, whatever. Serve right

away with some more basil on top to make that shit look as legit as it tastes.
