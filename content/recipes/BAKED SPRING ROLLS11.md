<div class="instructions"><h3 class="Instructions">Instructions</h3><div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p>1 Crank your oven to 400°F. Grab a large rimmed baking sheet.<br>2 In a large wok or skillet, warm up the oil over medium-high heat. Throw in the mushrooms, carrot, and celery and sauté until the mushrooms start to release a little of their liquid, about 2 minutes. Add the cabbage and green onions and cook until the cabbage has started to really cook down, about 3 minutes longer. It should now look like a normal amount of cabbage and not a shit-ton of leaves. Add the noodles, soy sauce or tamari, vinegar, and pepper and mix it around until there aren’t a bunch of dry-ass noodle or cabbage pockets hiding out. Remove from the heat.<br>3 To make the spring rolls, lay out one of the wrappers so one of the corners is pointed right at your body. Keep the remaining wrappers covered with a moist cloth or paper towel because they dry out really fucking quick. Turn the page to follow along.<br>Fig. 1: Grab a forkful of the filling and throw it down on the bottom third of the wrapper closest to you. Use some water on your fingers to get the edges all wet. This will help these fuckers close up in a second.<br>Fig. 2: Fold the bottom point of the wrapper up over the pile of filling, roll it once, then fold in the two side points so this shit looks like a child’s drawing of a 2 story house.<br>Fig. 3: Keep rolling until it’s all tight. Spray it gently with a bit of oil and place that deliciousness seam-side down on the baking sheet.<br>4 Keep going until you run out of filling or wrappers but you should get at least 12 outta all that shit. If you’re worried about how much filling you are piling in, always do a little less than you think. The more wrapper there is vs. the filling the crispier these little flavor cigars will be.<br>5 Throw the baking sheet in the oven and bake, turning the rolls halfway through, until both sides are golden and crispy, 30 to 35 minutes.<br>6 You can mix up the optional dipping sauce while the spring rolls are baking by just throwing the soy sauce or tamari, rice vinegar, water, hot sauce, sesame oil, agave, and garlic in a small bowl and stirring. Fucking done.<br>7 Let the rolls cool for a couple minutes and then serve those golden brown bitches with some dipping sauce and watch people lose their goddamn minds when they find out it’s not takeout.</p></div></div><div class="modifications"><h3 class="Notes">Notes</h3><p>WTF?</p></div></div>
