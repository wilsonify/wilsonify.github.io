# instructions
0 chop zucchini and bell pepper.
1 Make the savory grits and while they’re cooking, make the succotash. Grab a wok or large skillet and warm up the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, zucchini, and bell pepper and sauté that shit until the onion starts to look translucent, about 5 minutes.
2 Add the garlic, edamame, and corn and cook for another 3 minutes so everything gets warmed up. Add the basil, lemon juice, and salt. Stir that shit up, then turn off the heat.
3 Serve the grits up right away and top with the succotash and a couple pinches of the fresh herbs.

# modifications

Lima beans are more traditional, but we like edamame better. We’ll leave the decision up to you.
 This is about 1 corncob’s worth, but you can get kernels from the freezer if you really fucking have to.
