# CREAMY AVOCADO LIME DRESSING



#### yields  5 CUP (TRIPLE IT AND KEEP THIS  ER IN THE FRIDGE)


## ingredients
* 1 avocado 
* 1/3 cup lime juice 
* 1/4 cup water 
* 2 TBL rice vinegar 
* 1 clove garlic 
* 1/4 tsp ground cumin 
* 1 pinch salt 
* 2 TBL cilantro (optional)



## Instructions
1 Put all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and run it until everything looks all creamy, about 1 minute. If the dressing is too thick because you got an amazing avocado, add more water a TBL at a time until itâ€™s less like a dip and more like a goddamn dressing. Refrigerate until it is time to get dressed up.
