# SALSA VERDE
#### yields 4 TO 6, ABOUT 2.5 cup
## ingredients
* 1 1/2 LB s tomatillos
* 2 jalapeños jalapeños
0.5 white onion
* 2 clove garlic* 2 clove garlicr* 2 clove garlic* 2 clove garlic
* 1/8 tsp salt

# instructions
0 chop onion
1 Turn on the broiler in your oven and get it nice and hot.
2 Tear off all that loose, papery skin on the tomatillos and wash away all that sticky shit left on
the fruit. Put the tomatillos and jalapeños in a baking dish with sides and throw it under the
broiler.
3 Roast until the tomatillos are starting to blacken on top and the peppers are slightly
charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Flip those fuckers around halfway through roasting so that they get
a little roasted on all sides.
4 Once the tomatillos and jalapeños are cool enough to touch, roughly chop them up. If you
like a spicier salsa, leave the seeds in the jalapeños, otherwise fish those fuckers out as you chop.
5 In a food processor, combine the tomatillos, jalapeños, onion, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, and
salt and run that shit until you get a nice slightly chunky constancy, about 30 seconds.
6 Serve the salsa warm, at room temperature, or cold.

# modifications

They aren’t the same shit as green tomatoes. They have a papery outside skin that you peel away. Look for them in the fridge at a market that specializes in Mexican and Central American foods.
